The Middle East Conflict in Living Color and the American Civil War on Stage -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)171[3units]
Description: Over the past four years, this course has canvassed the Washington theater scene and discovered a wealth of politically and socially attuned material on DC stages. Washington has, rather suprisingly, emerged as the second most vibrant theatrical city in the nation, surpassing Chicago and Los Angeles in number of performances offered, audience in attendance, and union actors appearing in Equity-contracted productions. The city now boasts some of the finest classical, flagship, and culturally specific theaters in the country. This advent of a robust theater scene planted at the seat of power has created a unique cultural profile: that of an artistic force able to speak truth to power. Yet often times, theatrical institutions are constricted by the divided nature of the audience they play for, or the critical community that critiques them, or differing notions about the purpose of theater. What kind of portaits are emerging from area theaters in this politicized capital? What are the practical politics within these institutions that seek to engage and entertain their patrons?
