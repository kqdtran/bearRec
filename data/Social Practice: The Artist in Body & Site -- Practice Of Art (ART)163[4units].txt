Social Practice: The Artist in Body & Site -- Practice Of Art (ART)163[4units]
Description: Social Practice broadly refers to work produced through various forms of direct engagement with a site, social system or collaborator.  Interdisciplinary in nature, such work often takes the form of guerilla interventions, performance, institutional critique, community based public art and political activity, all sharing the premise that art created in the public sphere can help alter public perception and work toward social transformation.
