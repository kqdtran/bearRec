Health and Human Rights -- Health And Medical Sciences Program (HMEDSCI)212[1units]
Description: Public health and human rights are two complementary approaches to protecting and promoting human well-being and dignity. Enshrined in international law, human rights describe how governments must create conditions where individuals can achieve their full potential. Human rights abuses profoundly affect health; health policies can directly or indirectly impact human rights adversely. We explore these interrelationships and examine how the "right to health" is challenged both in war and peace.
