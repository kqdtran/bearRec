Topics in Latin American Culture -- Spanish (SPANISH)113[3units]
Description: The purpose of this course is to explore the roots of Latin American cultures, the region's search for identity, and some of the main problems it faces today. We will study great social movements, like the Mexican and Cuban revolutions, and analyze their causes and consequences and, especially, their expression in art (e.g. the muralist movement in Mexico, the "corridos" and the narrative of the Mexican revolution, etc.).
