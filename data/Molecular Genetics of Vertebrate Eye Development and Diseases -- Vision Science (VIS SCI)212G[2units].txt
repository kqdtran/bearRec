Molecular Genetics of Vertebrate Eye Development and Diseases -- Vision Science (VIS SCI)212G[2units]
Description: The primary focus of this course is to teach the molecular basis of vertebrate eye development and related disease. This course will cover some of the basic principles of molecular and cell biology, commonly used techniques and experimental approaches, as well as the biological mechanisms for vertebrate eye development and related eye diseases. Recent progress in identifying important ocular genes and the approaches used to identify them will be discussed.
