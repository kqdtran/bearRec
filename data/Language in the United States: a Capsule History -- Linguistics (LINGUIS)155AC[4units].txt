Language in the United States: a Capsule History -- Linguistics (LINGUIS)155AC[4units]
Description: This course brings together history, sociology, and linguistics to develop a deeper view of who we are as a nation. It is organized as a narrative history of the U.S. from the perspective of immigration and language. We devote significant portions to the languages of Native Americans, African American English, and to the Spanish spoken in the U.S., as well as addressing the various other dialects of American English, the numerous smaller immigrant languages, Hawaiian, and ASL.
