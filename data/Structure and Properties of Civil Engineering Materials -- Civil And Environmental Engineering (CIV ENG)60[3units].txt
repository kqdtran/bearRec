Structure and Properties of Civil Engineering Materials -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)60[3units]
Description: Introduction to structure and properties of civil engineering materials such as asphalt, cements, concrete, geological materials (e.g. soil and rocks), steel, polymers, and wood. The properties range from elastic, plastic and fracture properties to porosity and thermal and environmental responses. Laboratory tests include evaluation of behavior of these materials under a wide range of conditions.
