Urban School Reform -- Education (EDUC)269A[3units]
Description: American debates about effectiveness and equity and public interest in school reform focuses on city schools, and the commitment to reform is a recurrent theme in public discussions of education. At the same time, reformers often charge that urban schools are highly resistant to their efforts. In order to understand the potential of individual reform proposals and strategies, this course examines the place of school reforming in the institutional structure of schooling and the relationship of school reform to wider political relations and activity. Rather than examining sequentially individual reforms, this course will examine the range of reform agents and practices and different ways of understanding school reform. Particular attention is given to race and class as frames for understanding urban schooling.
