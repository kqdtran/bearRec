Big History--Cosmos, Earth, Life, and Humanity -- Earth And Planetary Science (EPS)51[4units]
Description: This course explores all four major regimes of history--cosmic history, Earth history, life history, and human history. Bringing together these normally unrelated topics, it seeks to understand the character of history by examining longterm trends and critical chance events, by looking for common causes underlying historical change in all four regimes, and by identifying the novelties that have made each regime unique. It offers a broad perspective for students interested in any one of the historical disciplines, helping them cross the barriers between fields of historical study.
