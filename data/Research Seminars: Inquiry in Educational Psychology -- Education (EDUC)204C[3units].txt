Research Seminars: Inquiry in Educational Psychology -- Education (EDUC)204C[3units]
Description: The doctoral program in Educational Psychology requires that students complete extensive projects of documentary and empirical research. As they engage in these projects, students will enroll (ordinarily during alternate years) in appropriate sections of this seminar. At each meeting, participants will present their own projects, and analyze those presented by others.
