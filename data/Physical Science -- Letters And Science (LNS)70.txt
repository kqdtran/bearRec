Physical Science -- Letters And Science (LNS)70
Description: Physical scientists seek to understand the universe, from its microscopic substructure to its largest structures, from our own earth to the edge of the universe and the beginning of time. Students fulfilling Physical Science breadth in the College of Letters & Science may be motivated by the pure pleasure of penetrating the mysteries of the universe, or by more practical considerations such as a desire to take an intelligent stance on such topics as greenhouse gases and space exploration. Whether students opt for the practical or the theoretical or a combination of both, students choosing a lower-division course in this series will learn to formulate problems clearly and think quantitatively, critically, and abstractly.
