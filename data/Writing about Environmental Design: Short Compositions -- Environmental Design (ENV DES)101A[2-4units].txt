Writing about Environmental Design: Short Compositions -- Environmental Design (ENV DES)101A[2-4units]
Description: An intensive workshop for students interested in writing about architecture, landscape, and the built environment. Recognizing that undergraduate students who take this course represent departments outside as well as within the College of Environmental Design, assignments are touchstones for students of different disciplines to bring their current academic interests into play when writing about environmental design. Weekly assignments include prose readings, generally essays related to life experience. Brief readings and discussions during each class, along with weekly writing assignments of 3-5 pages of prose will illustrate the skills involved in the craft of writing.
