A Window Into How Washington Works -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)165[4units]
Description: The federal government effects policy (e.g., enhancing public safety, protecting the environment, promoting a viable and growing economy, etc.) primarily in three ways: taxing, spending, and regulating. This course will explore how regulations -- an important instrument of government and one of the easiest ways for a President to make his/her mark -- are developed, amended, or repealed, with an emphasis on how the various institutions of the federal government are involved in the process and how they interact with the other interested entities.
