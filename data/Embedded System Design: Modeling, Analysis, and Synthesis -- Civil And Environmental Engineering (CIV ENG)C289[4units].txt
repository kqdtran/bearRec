Embedded System Design: Modeling, Analysis, and Synthesis -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)C289[4units]
Description: Principles of embedded system design. Focus on design methodologies and foundations. Platform-based design and communication-based design and their relationship with design time, re-use, and performance. Models of computation and their use in design capture, manipulation, verification, and synthesis. Mapping into architecture and systems platforms. Performance estimation. Scheduling and real-time requirements. Synchronous languages and time-triggered protocols to simplify the design process. Also listed as Electrical Engineering C249.
