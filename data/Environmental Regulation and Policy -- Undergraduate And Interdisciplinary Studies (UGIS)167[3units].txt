Environmental Regulation and Policy -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)167[3units]
Description: This course provides an introduction to some of the leading issues and themes in the development of modern environmental regulation in the United States. With the help of Richard Lazarus' survey, The Making of Environmental Law (2004), we will trace the creation and elaboration of the regulatory regime that has governed the use of American air, water, land, and wildlife resources since 1970. We will then look back to some of the classic expressions of the conservation ethic in America in the writings of John Muir, Rachel Carson, and others. We will examine certain ongoing challenges to the achievement of environmental protection goals, including in the area of climate change, and the tensions with economic and other societal imperatives inherent in attempted regulatory solutions to these challenges. The final class session(s) will be devoted to student presentations of research essay theses.
