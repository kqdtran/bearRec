Theater History -- Theater, Dance, And Performance Studies (THEATER)151B[3units]
Description: A chronological survey of Western theater from 1800 to the present, this course begins with the dismantling of Neoclassical thought in the European theater and the rise of avant-garde and popular forms. Rapidly changing social conditions, cultural tastes, and technological advances in the 19th and 20th centuries are studied in tandem with the development of theatrical productions and movements, playmaking, and acting styles.
