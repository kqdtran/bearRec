Digital Communications -- Electrical Engineering (EL ENG)224A[4units]
Description: Introduction to the basic principles of the design and analysis of modern digital communication systems. Topics include source coding; channel coding; baseband and passband modulation techniques; receiver design; channel equalization; information theoretic techniques; block, convolutional, and trellis coding techniques; multiuser communications and spread spectrum; multi-carrier techniques and FDM; carrier and symbol synchronization. Applications to design of digital telephone modems, compact disks, and digital wireless communication systems are illustrated. The concepts are illustrated by a sequence of MATLAB exercises.
