Research Design -- Sociology (SOCIOL)275[3units]
Description: This course will take students through the process of developing, carrying out, and writing up a research project. The course is ideal for students working on their MA papers, but it is also appropriate for students who are formulating dissertation prospectuses. We will begin by reading a guide to the logical problems that all research methods, qualitative or quantitative, must address if they are to study social causation.
