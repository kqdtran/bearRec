Professional Writing Seminar -- Sociology (SOCIOL)286[3units]
Description: This seminar is a workshop on professional writing for sociologists. We will focus on editing, rewriting, re-editing, and re-rewriting seminar members' papers with the goal of completing a paper appropriate for the professional journals. In addition, we will cover several topics in writing, including psychological inhibition, style, journals, writing for the general public, and the world of book publishing. Class time will be divided into short lectures and workshop periods, during which we will discuss work in-progress and do some collective editing of sample texts.
