Queer Translation -- Gender And Women'S Studies (GWS)250[4units]
Description: This seminar aims for both a familiarization and a potential reworking of selected contemporary debates in queer theory: those concerning migration, race, globalization, and movements of theory. How do queer theories, queer theories-as-practice, queer practices travel? Furthermore, do critiques of stability found in queer theory invite presumptions of mobility? We will interrogate the shadow of "mobility" in queer theory by considering queer tourism, gender identity, sub-class labor migration, and the outer zones of citizenship.
