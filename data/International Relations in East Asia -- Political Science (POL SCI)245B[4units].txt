International Relations in East Asia -- Political Science (POL SCI)245B[4units]
Description: This seminar will focus on postwar relations among the countries in East Asia. Asia was long divided by colonialism, the Cold War, and America's "hub and spoke" alliance system. Nationalist sentiments and suspicions remain strong; one scholar characterized the region as "the cockpit of great power rivalries." Northeast Asia has seen no shooting wars between states since the Korean armistice in 1953; Southeast Asia has been at peace since the pullback of Vietnam from Cambodia in 1979.
