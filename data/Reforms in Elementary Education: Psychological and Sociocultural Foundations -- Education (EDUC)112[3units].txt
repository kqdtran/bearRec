Reforms in Elementary Education: Psychological and Sociocultural Foundations -- Education (EDUC)112[3units]
Description: The course introduces students to relationships between research on cognitive development and reforms in elementary teaching. The syllabus is organized in modules that link research and classroom practice. For example, in a module on children's mathematics, we analyze research on children's strategies for solving math problems and consider how this research has reformed teaching practices. Students complete a project for each module that links research and observations in elementary classrooms through concurrent enrollment in one unit of 197.
