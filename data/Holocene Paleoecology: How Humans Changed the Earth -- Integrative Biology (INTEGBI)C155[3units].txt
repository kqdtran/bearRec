Holocene Paleoecology: How Humans Changed the Earth -- Integrative Biology (INTEGBI)C155[3units]
Description: Since the end of the Pleistocene and especially with the development of agriculturally based societies humans have had cumulative and often irreversible impacts on natural landscapes and biotic resources worldwide. Thus "global change" and the biodiversity crisis are not exclusively developments of the industrial and post-industrial world. This course uses a multi-disciplinary approach, drawing upon methods and data from archaeology, palynology, geomorphology, paleontology, and historical ecology to unravel the broad trends of human ecodynamics over the past 10,000 years. Also listed as Anthropology C129D.
