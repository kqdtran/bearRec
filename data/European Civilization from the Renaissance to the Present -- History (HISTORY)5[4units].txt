European Civilization from the Renaissance to the Present -- History (HISTORY)5[4units]
Description: This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe--a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place-- became the motor of globalization and a world civilzation in its own right. Put differently how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern".
