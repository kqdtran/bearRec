Introduction to New Product Development -- Chemical And Biomolecular Engineering (CHM ENG)295P[3units]
Description: This course is part of the product development initative sponsored by the department of chemical engineering. It focuses on real-life practices and challenges of translating scientific discovery into commercial products. Its scope is limited in most circumstances to situations where some knowledge of chemical engineering, chemistry, and related disciplines might prove to be particularly useful. The course primarily uses case studies of real-world new product development situations to simulate the managerial and technical challenges that will confront students in the field. We will cover a wide range of topics including basic financial, strategic and intellectual property concepts for products, managing risk and uncertainity, the effective new product development team, the evolving role of corporate R&D, the new venture product company and the ethics of post-launch product management.
