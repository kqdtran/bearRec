Soil Microbial Ecology -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)131[3units]
Description: Description: Introduction to the organisms that live in the soil and their activities in the soil ecosystem. Lectures will cover the physical and chemical properties of soils and the soil as a habitat for microorganisms, the diversity and ecology of soil microorganisms, and their activity in the context of biogeochemical cycling, plant-microbe interactions, global environmental change and bioremediation. Goals: To gain fundamental knowledge of the occurrence and activities of soil microorganisms and their influence on soil productivity and environmental quality as well as potential applications of soil microbiology. This course is targeted at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students who require a comprehensive treatment of the field of soil microbiology. Topics will include: Soil as a habitat for microorganisms, Occurrence and distribution of soil organisms, Methods for studying soil microorganisms, Carbon cycling and soil organic matter, Biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and metals, Xenobiotic degradation and bioremediation.
