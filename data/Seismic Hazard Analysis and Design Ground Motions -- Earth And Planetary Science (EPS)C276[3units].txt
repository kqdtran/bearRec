Seismic Hazard Analysis and Design Ground Motions -- Earth And Planetary Science (EPS)C276[3units]
Description: Deterministic and probabilistic approaches for seismic hazard analysis. Separation of uncertainty into aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty. Discussion of seismic source and ground motion characterization and hazard computation. Development of time histories for dynamic analyses of structures and seismic risk computation, including selection of ground motion parameters for estimating structural response, development of fragility curves, and methods for risk calculations. Also listed as Civil and Environmental Engineering C276.
