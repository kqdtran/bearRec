Visualization and Simulation for Engineering and Management -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)169C[1units]
Description: A series of course modules on computer methods and tools for engineering and management, emphasizing the systems approach. Each 1 unit module will run for a segment of the semester, and will cover theory and hands-on laboratory exercises. Students may take 1-3 modules per semester. Representation and modeling, visualization, use of different graphic formats, and simulation in engineering and management research and practice. The course is a combination of lectures, readings, hands-on exercises, homework assignments, and a project. The project is an opportunity for students to develop a web-based application suitable to their own interests.
