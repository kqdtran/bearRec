Governance of the E-conomy -- Political Science (POL SCI)201D[4units]
Description: New digital technologies, changing market structures, and innovative business organizations are transforming the economic and social landscape of the advanced industrial countries. The policy issues associated with this transformation pose fundamental philosophical and political questions of how to organize our markets, polity, and society. The means of making and implementing these choices is politics. The necessarily global scope of the E-conomy extends the political and policy challenges to the international arena. This course will explore the literature on the political economy of the Internet to determine what policy choices -- hence which political debates -- are and will be most important. We also will examine our conceptual understanding of the burgeoning digital economy and its impact on politics, law, and socio-economic relations.
