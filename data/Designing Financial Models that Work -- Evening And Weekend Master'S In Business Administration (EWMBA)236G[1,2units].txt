Designing Financial Models that Work -- Evening And Weekend Master'S In Business Administration (EWMBA)236G[1,2units]
Description: Spreadsheet financial models are often too big, complicated, and buggy to help people. In this course, students learn to design financial models that work because they're small (fit on a screen or two), straightforward (involve basic math), clear (a non-MBA can follow them readily), and fast to build. These simple yet powerful representations of the cash flow for a new product/deal/venture help people share their vision, recognize tradeoffs, brainstorm possibilities, and make decisions.
