Introduction to Aging Issues and Opportunities in Aging Professions -- Health And Medical Sciences Program (HMEDSCI)150[2units]
Description: This course will explore current issues in aging from biological, demographic, psycho-social, and policy perspectives. To begin, lectures will focus on: The changing demographics of the general population of which older adults are becoming a larger and larger percentage; How men and women age differently; The historical context within which aging has been viewed; The physical and mental changes that occur over time. These initial lectures will provide the foundation for the lectures that follow in which professionals present issues--unique to their field--that they encounter in meeting the needs of their elderly clientele. Representative professions will include law, medicine, dentistry, architecture, social welfare, optometry, speech and physical therapy. The importance of an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving will be emphasized as speakers highlight pertinent issues in this population through case study scenarios. By using case studies we will shift the focus from "the disease" or "condition" to "the person." Speakers will discuss how they became interested in their respective professions and what opportunities/ challenges await a new generation of professionals.
