Race, Gender, and Immigration: Citizenship and Education -- Education (EDUC)287[3units]
Description: U.S. citizenship has been defined in racialized and gendered terms since the nation's founding. This course explores how those definitions have affected the historical development of U.S. public schooling, particularly the unequal educational opportunities available to racial minorities and women, and how they have affected American approaches to civic education.
