Advanced Design and Automation -- Mechanical Engineering (MEC ENG)239[4units]
Description: This course will provide students with a solid understanding of smart products and the use of embedded microcomputers in products and machines. The course has two components: 1.) Formal lectures. Students receive a set of formal lectures on the design of smart machines and products that use embedded microcomputers. The materials cover machine components, actuators, sensors, basic electronic devices, embedded microprocessor systems and control, power transfer components, and mechanism design. 2.) Projects. Students will design and construct prototype products that use embedded microcomputers.
