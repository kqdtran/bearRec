Structural Inequalities and Reproductive Health -- Public Health (PB HLTH)255E[2units]
Description: This course will address the role that structural inequalities assume in shaping reproductive health disparities. We will examine relevant epidemiological research, review and critique public health interventions, and discuss how research in this area can inform policy. The course will be organized around three modules, each linked to reproductive health: poverty, gender-based violence, and migration. Within each module, students will examine measurement, research design, and ethical challenges.
