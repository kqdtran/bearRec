Vehicle Dynamics and Control -- Mechanical Engineering (MEC ENG)131[3units]
Description: Physical understanding of automotive vehicle dynamics including simple lateral, longitudinal, and ride quality models. An overview of active safety systems will be introduced including the basic concepts and terminology, the state-of-the-art development, and basic principles of systems such as ABS, traction control, dynamic stability control, and roll stability control. Passive, semi-active, and active suspension systems will be analyzed. Concepts of autonomous vehicle technology including drive-by-wire and steer-by-wire systems, adaptive cruise control, and lane keeping systems. Upon completion of this course, students should be able to follow the literature on these subjects and perform independent design, research, and development work in this field.
