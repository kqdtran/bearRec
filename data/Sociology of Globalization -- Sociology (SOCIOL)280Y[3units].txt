Sociology of Globalization -- Sociology (SOCIOL)280Y[3units]
Description: Sociology now analyzes social organization that transcends national boundaries, not just as linking national societies or as influencing national societies, but as a phenomenon in its own right. This course brings together a selection of literature that looks at transnational social organizations and the distinctive dynamics of global political economy and culture and offers a sociological perspective on what lies behind the vague and confusing label of "globalization."
