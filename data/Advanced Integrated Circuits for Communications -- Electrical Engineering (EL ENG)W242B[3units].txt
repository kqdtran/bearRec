Advanced Integrated Circuits for Communications -- Electrical Engineering (EL ENG)W242B[3units]
Description: Analysis, evaluation, and design of present-day integrated circuits for communications application, particularly those for which nonlinear response must be included. MOS, bipolar and BICMOS circuits, audio and video power amplifiers, optimum performance of near-sinusoidal oscillators and frequency-translation circuits. Phase-locked loop ICs, analog multipliers and voltage-controlled oscillators; advanced components for telecommunication circuits. Use of new CAD tools and systems.
