High School, The Movie -- Education (EDUC)183[3units]
Description: High school plays a pivotal role in American life. It both serves as a gatekeeper of educational and economic success and embodies hopes of transcending social divisions. Like high school itself, movies about it have fostered youth culture and helped Americans make sense of the intersection of democratic aspirations and social divisions. This course examines how the reality and representation of high schools combine to reflect and define American society and the lives of American youth.
