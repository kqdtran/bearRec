Statistical Mechanics of Elasticity -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)C235[3units]
Description: Introduction to statistical mechanics for engineers interested in the constitutive behavior of matter with a particular interest in continua. Systems of interest will be polymers and crystalline solids. Coverage includes introduction to statistical mechanics, ensembles, phase spaces, partitions functions, free energy, polymer chain statistics, polymer networks, harmonic and quasi-harmonic crystalline solids, limitations of classical methods and quantum mechanical influences. Also listed as Mechanical Engineering C279.
