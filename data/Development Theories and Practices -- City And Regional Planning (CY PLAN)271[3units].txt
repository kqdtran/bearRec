Development Theories and Practices -- City And Regional Planning (CY PLAN)271[3units]
Description: This course covers the theory and praxis of international development. It studies the project of development, from its Cold War launching to its metamorphosis into the current era of economic globalization and liberalization. And it examines the theoretical models and discursive debates that have accompanied each phase, including the recent critiques put forth by feminism and postcolonialism. The course also locates development in the industrialized world, "here" rather than "elsewhere," thereby unsettling the normalized hierarchy of First and Third Worlds.
