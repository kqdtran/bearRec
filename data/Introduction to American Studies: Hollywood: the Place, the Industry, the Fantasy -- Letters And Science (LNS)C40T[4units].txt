Introduction to American Studies: Hollywood: the Place, the Industry, the Fantasy -- Letters And Science (LNS)C40T[4units]
Description: This course will introduce students to the interdisciplinary field of American Studies, taking the "Hollywood Dream Factory" as the central theme. Focusing on both parts of that phrase, the course will proceed along a double path. We will examine the historical and geographical development of the motion picture industry from the rise of the studio system to the "new" entertainment economy of the 1980's and we will examine ways Hollywood is represented in literature and film. Also listed as American Studies C10.
