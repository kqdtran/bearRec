Origins: from the Big Bang to the Emergence of Humans -- Integrative Biology (INTEGBI)C13[4units]
Description: This course will cover our modern scientific understanding of origins, from the Big Bang to the formation of planets like Earth, evolution by natural selection, the genetic basis of evolution, and the emergence of humans. These ideas are of great intrinsic scientific importance and also have far reaching implications for other aspects of people's lives (e.g., philosophical, religious, and political). A major theme will be the scientific method and how we know what we know. Also listed as Astronomy C13.
