Capital, Value, and Scale -- Geography (GEOG)220[4units]
Description: This seminar focuses on major works in political economy and social theory concerning capitalism, human action, and space-time. First we grapple with what "value" means in volume 1 of Capital, paying particular attention to issues of historical specificity, abstract labor time, and the "value theory of labor," then we spatialize the argument by a close reading of David Harvey's classic, Limits to Capital. Next, we look at attempts to understand capital's relation to human action and other forms of value, specifically in anthropology and the work of Pierre Bourdieu. Finally, we take up the issue of scale in hope of formulating a coherent conceptual framework for integrating across scales, from the human-body (or even smaller scales) up to global economic, cultural, and ecological processes.
