Description: The students will learn fundamental principles and advanced techniques in microbial genetics. The use of genetics in deducing biochemical pathways, protein interactions, and signal transduction pathways will be explores through reading and discussion of current and classic papers from the primary literature. Experimental design and interpretation will be the focus of problem sets solved in student-coordinated sessions.
