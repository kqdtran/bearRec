Hierarchical Statistical Modeling in Environmental Science -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)215[2units]
Description: Hierarchical statistical models include generalized linear mixed models, generalized additive mixed models, state-space models for time-series data, and random field models for spatial data. Introduction to formulation and analysis of such models with frequentist methods, including maximum likelihood via numerical integration and restricted maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods, including Markov chain Monte Carlo. Background in relevant probability theory.
