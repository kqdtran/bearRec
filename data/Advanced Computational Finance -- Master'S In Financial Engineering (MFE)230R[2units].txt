Advanced Computational Finance -- Master'S In Financial Engineering (MFE)230R[2units]
Description: This course builds on the techniques learned in 230D, Quantitative Methods for Derivative Pricing. The focus is to gain a deeper analysis of numerical and computational issues in pricing and calibration. The orientation of the course is hands-on, with heavy use of computational techniques applied to case projects. The primary objective of this course is to prepare students to tackle the latest challenges in quantitative pricing that they are likely to encounter in cutting-edge financial institutions.
