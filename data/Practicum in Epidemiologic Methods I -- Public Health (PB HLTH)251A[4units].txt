Practicum in Epidemiologic Methods I -- Public Health (PB HLTH)251A[4units]
Description: A two-semester sequence intended for students in the Epidemiology/Biostatistics MPH program and other qualified graduate students. This is a practicum course in research design data analysis. Students select a research question and learn practical skills to analyze a large database in order to answer the research question. The course teaches use of CMS and SAS in performing univariate analyses; students also learn critically to review scientific literature. Students are required to complete computer assignments, an oral presentation of a literature review with handouts for class, a final presentation (as would be presented at a scientific meeting), and a final report in a style for a publishable manuscript.
