Project Management -- Engineering (ENGIN)290P[2units]
Description: This course will provide you with a comprehensive view of the elements of modern project management, guidelines for success, and related tools. In organizations today, successful operations keep the organization alive and successful projects move it towards strategic objectives. A project is a one-time or infrequently occurring operation with a unique goal, limited lifespan, and limited resources. The fundamental concepts come from the field of operations management, but projects present special types of operations because of their intended focus, limited lives, constraints, and uncertainties. In organizations today, projects are many, diverse, and frequently overlapping.
