Anthropology of the Contemporary -- Anthropology (ANTHRO)156[4units]
Description: This course is an introduction to the conceptual field of "the contemporary," a stylization of both old and new elements that stands in contrast to "modernity", and "post modernity", and which opens up inquiries into the actual state of things, particulary for anthropology. Anthropology 155, while not required, is highly recommended as a prerequisite.
