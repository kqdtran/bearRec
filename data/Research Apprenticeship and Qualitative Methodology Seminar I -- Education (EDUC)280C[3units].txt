Research Apprenticeship and Qualitative Methodology Seminar I -- Education (EDUC)280C[3units]
Description: The emphasis in this course is on the practice of research. Each student, ordinarily in the second year of graduate study, develops a research project with a faculty mentor and carries it out under direction. At the same time, students work together in this seminar. Short written assignments during the first eight weeks result in a research proposal to be carried out by the end of the semester. Students spend about 50 hours on the field research.
