Revising the Classics: Chinese and Greek Poetry in Translation -- East Asian Languages And Cultures (EA LANG)108[4units]
Description: An introductory course on Chinese poetry, both ancient and modern, in English translation. The course will explore poetic translation, across languages, across cultures, and across historical ages, not merely from the perspective of the "accuracy" with which a classic text is represented in the translation, but as a window into the nature of poetic tradition and poetic writing itself. Works to be covered in the course will be primarily drawn from the Chinese tradition, but in the interest of allowing a comparative discussion of the course's central themes, a significant amount of reading, also in translation, from ancient and modern Greek poetry will be included as well. The goal of the class is not simply to gain familiarity with Chinese poetry and poets, but more fundamentally to gain skill and sophistication in reading, responding to, and thinking about poetry.
