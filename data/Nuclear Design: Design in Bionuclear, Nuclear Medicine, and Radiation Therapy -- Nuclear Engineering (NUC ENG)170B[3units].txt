Nuclear Design: Design in Bionuclear, Nuclear Medicine, and Radiation Therapy -- Nuclear Engineering (NUC ENG)170B[3units]
Description: A systems approach to the development of procedures for nuclear medicine and radiation therapy. Each semester a specific procedure will be studied and will entail the development of the biological and physiological basis for a procedure, the chemical and biochemical characteristics of appropriate drugs, dosimetric requirements and limitations, the production and distribution of radionuclides and/or radiation fields to be applied, and the characteristics of the instrumentation to be used.
