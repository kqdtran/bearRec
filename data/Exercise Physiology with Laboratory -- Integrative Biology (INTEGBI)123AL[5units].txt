Exercise Physiology with Laboratory -- Integrative Biology (INTEGBI)123AL[5units]
Description: Discussion of how chemical energy is captured within cells and how potential chemical energy is converted to muscular work. Energetics, direct and indirect calorimetry, pathways of carbon flow in exercise, ventilation, circulation, skeletal muscle fiber types. Laboratory component of the course is to obtain practical experience in the measurement of physiological parameters and to be able to compile, compare, contrast, and interpret physiological data. Laboratory demonstrations and exercises will explain lecture content.
