Buddhism on the Silk Road -- Buddhist Studies (BUDDSTD)C120[4units]
Description: This course is both an historical introduction to the Silk Road, understood as an ever-changing series of peoples, places, and traditions, as well as an introduction to the study of those same peoples, places, and traditions in the modern period. In this way, the class is intended both as a guide to the extant textual, archaeological, and art historical evidence from the Silk Road, but also as a framework for thinking about what it means to study Asia and Asian religions in the context of a contemporary American classroom. All readings will be in English. Also listed as East Asian Languages and Cultures C120.
