Lobbying, Money, and Influence in Washington -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)162I[4units]
Description: This course will be an intense examination of lobbying in Washington with particular attention given to the role of money and campaign finance in the operation of what has become a highly sophisticated and poorly understood network of advocacy and influence. The approach of the instructor is to provide a basic understanding of three different but interrelated knowledge sets: the Congress, political money, and lobbying by interest groups.
