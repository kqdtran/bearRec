Strategies of Contemporary Governance -- Political Science (POL SCI)284[4units]
Description: This course explores the implications of new strategies for coping with social problems and managing public programs. In response to growing criticism of government bureaucracy, public skepticism of expert authority, and an explosion of advocacy groups, a variety of new governance strategies have been developed. These new strategies are characterized by five broad themes: the use of markets or market mechanisms to increase efficiency; an emphasis on holding public agencies accountable and making them more transparent; the development of coordinating networks to link public agencies with each other and with stakeholders; the extensive involvement of non-state organizations in all aspects of governing; and renewed attention to the civic role of individuals and communities. The course investigates the extent to which these new strategies succeed in making the governance process more efficient, accountable, effective, representative, and civic.
