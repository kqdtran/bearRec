Working People in the Global Economy -- Letters And Science (LNS)C150T[4units]
Description: Work is central to our identities, self-esteem, well-being, and social status. How societies organize work shapes the distribution of rewards and power, not just in the workplace but in society at large. Everyone's work is profoundly shaped by the way it connects to other people's labor around the globe. Using a variety of disciplinary lenses, we will look at working people world wide and examine how the organized efforts of working people have shaped the nature of jobs and social change. Also listed as Sociology C116G.
