Synthetic Biology Laboratory -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)140L[4units]
Description: This laboratory course is designed as an introduction to research in synthetic biology, a ground-up approach to genetic engineering with applications in bioenergy, heathcare, materials science, and chemical production. In this course, we will design and execute a real research project. Each student will be responsible for designing and constructing components for the group project and then performing experiments to analyze the system. In addition to laboratory work, we will have lectures on methods and design concepts in synthetic biology including an introduction to Biobricks, gene synthesis, computer modeling, directed evolution, practical molecular biology, and biochemistry.
