Nuclear Physics in High Energy Density Plasmas -- Nuclear Engineering (NUC ENG)290J[3units]
Description: This course provides an introduction to the nuclear processes taking place in the High Energy Density (HED) plasmas present in astrophysical settings and the new generation of laser-driven inertial confinement fusion facilities.  Topics covered will include a description of the new generation of laser-driven inertial confinement fusion facilities, the role of nuclear-plasma induced excited state population on reaction rates, and the experimental methods used to diagnose HED plasmas.
