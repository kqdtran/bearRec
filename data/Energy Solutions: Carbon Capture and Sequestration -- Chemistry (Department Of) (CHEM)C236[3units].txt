Energy Solutions: Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- Chemistry (Department Of) (CHEM)C236[3units]
Description: After a brief overview of the chemistry of carbon dioxide in the land, ocean, and atmosphere, the course will survey the capture and sequestration of CO2 from anthropogenic sources. Emphasis will be placed on the integration of materials synthesis and unit operation design, including the chemistry and engineering aspects of sequestration. The course primarily addresses scientific and engineering challenges and aims to engage students in state-of-the-art research in global energy challenges. Also listed as Earth and Planetary Science C295Z and Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering C295Z.
