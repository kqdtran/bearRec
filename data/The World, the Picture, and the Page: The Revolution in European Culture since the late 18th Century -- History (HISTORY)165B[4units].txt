The World, the Picture, and the Page: The Revolution in European Culture since the late 18th Century -- History (HISTORY)165B[4units]
Description: Europe has experienced three revolutions in the past two centuries. The first was political, the second was economic, and the third was what Raymond Williams called the "cultural revolution" - the dramatic shift from a largely oral and iconographic world to one of universal literacy and the technology of modern communications. By means of readings, lectures, discussions, films and slides, the class will examine the meaning of the revolutionary change for the lives of ordinary men and women, as well as the responses of selected writers, artists, and social theorists to the culture of democratization.
