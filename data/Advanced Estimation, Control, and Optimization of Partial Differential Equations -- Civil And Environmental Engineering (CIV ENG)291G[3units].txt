Advanced Estimation, Control, and Optimization of Partial Differential Equations -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)291G[3units]
Description: This course will cover advanced methods in estimation, control, and optimization of distributed parameter systems (partial differential equations in particular). The course builds on 291 and covers discrete methods relying on finite differencing such as quadratic programming for optimal control and variational data assimilation, (ensemble, extended) Kalman filtering. The course covers distributed transfer function analysis and frequency responses of PDEs, and characteristics-based stability analysis.
