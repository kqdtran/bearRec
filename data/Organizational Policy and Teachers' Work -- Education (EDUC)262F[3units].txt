Organizational Policy and Teachers' Work -- Education (EDUC)262F[3units]
Description: Students will examine the ways in which state, district, and workplace policy bears upon various aspects of teachers' work. Special emphasis is given to the way in which policy choices--at whatever level--shape the experience of teaching and the organization of schooling. Among the policy areas considered are those governing membership in the teaching occupation, teaching assignments, classroom autonomy regarding curriculum and instruction, performance evaluation, and opportunities for professional development. This course is a requirement for students in educational administration and those students completing the Professional Administration Services Credential. It is open to all other interested students.
