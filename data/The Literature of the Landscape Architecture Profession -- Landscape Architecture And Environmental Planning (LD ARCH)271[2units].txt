The Literature of the Landscape Architecture Profession -- Landscape Architecture And Environmental Planning (LD ARCH)271[2units]
Description: Investigation of ideas in landscape architecture through the study of Landscape Architecture, the discipline's primary American professional magazine. Beginning with the premier 1911 issue, five to ten year blocks of time will be studied to identify major values, theories and methods covered by the magazine in each given period. The content of the magazine articles will be related to other design and planning publications of the same period. The intent is to trace and understand the evolving focus of the landscape architecture profession and how it has responded to broader cultural movements. Topics may include aesthetics, ecological determinism, artistic movements, social values, preservation/conservation issues and the role of the professional in public life.
