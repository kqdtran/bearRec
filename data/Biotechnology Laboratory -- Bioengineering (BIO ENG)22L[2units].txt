Biotechnology Laboratory -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)22L[2units]
Description: This course is intended to introduce students to a variety of laboratory techniques that are used in current day biotechnology projects. During this course, students will get hands-on molecular and cellular biotechnology experience working with E. coli, Yeast, Human and Mouse Cell Lines, DNA, RNA, and proteins. This is a bioengineering course; the focus of these exercises will be on the critical understanding of biological, biochemical, or physical mechanisms, and theories of different experiemental methods, techniques, and instrumentation used. Second, students leaving this class should understand how to address a critical biological question and design experiments in a quantitative manner.
