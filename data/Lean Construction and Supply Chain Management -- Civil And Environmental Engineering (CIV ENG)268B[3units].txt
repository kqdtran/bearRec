Lean Construction and Supply Chain Management -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)268B[3units]
Description: Principles and practices of "lean" production are applied to project delivery in the AEC industry. Case studies illustrate the concepts. Project delivery is viewed holistically with a focus on work structuring and supply chain management. Topics include systems dynamics, uncertainty, and variation; materials management; logistics; e-commerce; building information modeling (BIM); and integrated product and process design. Students use process simulation to assess performance of different system configurations and develop a case study applying concepts on a real project.
