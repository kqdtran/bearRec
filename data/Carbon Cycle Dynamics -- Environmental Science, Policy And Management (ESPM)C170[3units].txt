Carbon Cycle Dynamics -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)C170[3units]
Description: The focus is the (unsolved) puzzle of the contemporary carbon cycle. Why is the concentration of atmospheric CO2 changing at the rate observed? What are the terrestrial and oceanic processes that add and remove carbon from the atmosphere? What are the carbon management strategies under discussion? How can emission protocols be verified? Students are encouraged to gain hands-on experience with the available data, and learn modeling skills to evaluate hypotheses of carbon sources and sinks. Also listed as Earth and Planetary Science C183.
