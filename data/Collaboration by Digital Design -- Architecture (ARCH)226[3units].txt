Collaboration by Digital Design -- Architecture (ARCH)226[3units]
Description: This project-based seminar studies the problem of multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural collaboration in the building industry. It employs two complementary approaches: 1) a theoretical approach, which examines the nature of collaboration in general and in architecture in particular, looks at the methods that have been used to foster and support it, and interrogates their advantages and shortcomings; and 2) a practical approach, which use a web-based multi-person design 'game' that allow students to play different roles (architect, clients, engineer, builder, etc.) while collaborating in the design of a building.
