Description: Imagination is the foundation for creative expression in the landscape. This course encourages exploration and personal expression for the realization of new landscape forms. This laboratory intends to refine drawing compositional skills by fostering imagination, intuition, and creativity. The media explored will be pen and ink, watercolor, collage, and 3-dimensional construction. We will study the human figure through analytical drawings and live models. The realms of moving images, the landscape of the animated cartoon, and the sequential art of the comic will be investigated.
