Energy, Fantasy, and Form -- Landscape Architecture And Environmental Planning (LD ARCH)103[5units]
Description: This is an undergraduate studio with a central focus on climate modification for energy conservation. We will research historical precedents in order to develop new garden forms for passive green designs. We will also explore how past cultures integrated metaphysics into their gardens as an adjunct to microclimate and habitat design. The contemporary landscape should be a balanced interweaving of proportion, function, comfort, energy conservation, and enlightenment. Additionally, we will study the choreography of space and investigate how to animate the landscape through the creative interpretation of text and film. Many new and exciting opportunities lie ahead for the creation of garden forms that not only conserve energy, but are also works of art and places of spiritual renewal.
