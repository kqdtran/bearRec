Introduction to Product Development -- Mechanical Engineering (MEC ENG)110[3units]
Description: Provides project-based learning experience in innovative new product development, with a focus on mechanical engineering systems. Design concepts and techniques are introduced, and the student's design ability is developed in a design or feasibility study chosen to emphasize ingenuity and provide wide coverage of engineering topics. Relevant software will be integrated into studio sessions, including solid modeling and environmental life cycle analysis. Design optimization and social, economic, and political implications are included. All product ideas will be evaluated against the "triple bottom line": economic, societal, and environmental. Both individual and group oral presentations are made, and participation in a final tradeshow type presentation is required.
