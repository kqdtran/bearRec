Metals in Organic Synthesis -- Chemistry (Department Of) (CHEM)262[1units]
Description: Transition metal-mediated reactions occupy a central role in asymmetric catalysis and the synthesis of complex molecules. This course will describe the general principles of transition metal reactivity, coordination chemistry, and stereoselection. This module will also emphasize useful methods for the analysis of these reactions.
