Language Socialization -- Education (EDUC)241B[3units]
Description: Throughout the lifespan we are socialized through language to become competent participants and members of various groups and communities, including schooling institutions. For the past 20 years, this theory and method for analyzing human development has made important contribution to our understanding of how we learn to become competent members of community, how we learn through language, and how we are socialized into language. This course will provide opportunities to overview the theoretical cornerstones of language socialization as a field of study, as well as review current studies and chart future research trajectories. Course participants are expected to collect and analyze audio/video data from any educational and other learning context where language socialization might be taking place.
