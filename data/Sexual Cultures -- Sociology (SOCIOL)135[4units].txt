Sexual Cultures -- Sociology (SOCIOL)135[4units]
Description: This course examines how sexual identities, communities, desires, and practices are socially, historically, and culturally constructed. We will look at how people reproduce dominant models of sexuality, as well as how a wide range of people--including lesbians, bisexuals, gay men, transgenderists, and self-described queers--contest the power that operates through dominant models of sexuality. Looking at empirical studies and theoretical texts, we will trace the paradigm shift from late 19th century sexology to early 20th century psychoanalysis, through a variety of approaches in the 1960's and 1970's to the feminist and queer theory of recent decades.
