Disability Studies in Practice -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)113[3units]
Description: A graded service-learning internship course in disability studies. Students will draw lessons from working in collaboration with major disability rights and independent living organizations. Each student will do an internship at one of these organizations for six hours a week. In an additional one-hour a week seminar together, students will first prepare for the internships, setting objectives for skills to be learned and planning effective projects, and then analyze and reflect on the work done, both in order to create greater understanding of each intern's individual experiences and in order to think critically about how "service" and "organizing" can address the needs and goals of the disability community. Students must apply in advance for admission into this course.
