The Geography of Economic Development in China -- Geography (GEOG)164[4units]
Description: This course focuses on four issues in contemporary China: (1) the transformation of the socialist state, (2) the politics of resource struggle, (3) the interplay of gender and class in the transitional society, and (4) Chinese Diaspora and business networks in the context of globalization. Each of these issues will be examined with reference to theories of development and histories of China. We will also take a critical approach in our exploration of China's development. This is a lecture course designed mainly for upper level undergraduate students with preliminary background in East Asian-Chinese studies or development studies or both.
