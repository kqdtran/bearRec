U.S. Supreme Court: Judicial Politics and Constitutional Interpretation -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)162J[4units]
Description: This course will introduce students to the Supreme Court of the United States and its work. Besides covering the Court's historical origins, its institutional power and limitations, and its current cases, this course will attempt to de-mystify one of the nation's most cloistered governmental institutions. Students will learn the nuts and bolts of what happens to a case from the day a petition to review a dispute arrives at the Supreme Court until the day the justices issue a final opinion.
