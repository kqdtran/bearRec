The African American Tradition of Critical Educational Thought and Practice -- Education (EDUC)283C[3units]
Description: Educational projects of asserting and reconstructing African American humanity, of claiming a place in American life, or of building separate Black institutions and culture have been central concerns of Black intellectuals. While this course surveys the history of African American education and the evolving forms of white supremacy in schooling, it is primarily an engagement with the ways that African Americans have conceptualized education and its transformation.
