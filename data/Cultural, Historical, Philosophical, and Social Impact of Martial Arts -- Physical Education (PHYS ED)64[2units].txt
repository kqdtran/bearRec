Description: This course is designed for students to learn historical and cultural contexts in which various martial arts have emerged; how they have been influenced by historical, philosophical, cultural, social, political, and educational developments; what functions they once performed; and the place they hold in contemporary societies. Recent research will be studied regarding the physiological and psychological dimensions of martial arts and their contribution to physical and mental health. An essential component of such martial arts as Judo and Taekwondo is the development of strong moral and ethical values. Students will study why and how these are developed and how to be able to use this information in bettering their own lives.
