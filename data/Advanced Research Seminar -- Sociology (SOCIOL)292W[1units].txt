Advanced Research Seminar -- Sociology (SOCIOL)292W[1units]
Description: The purpose of this seminar is to provide students an opportunity to present their work in progress (academic journal submission, dissertation chapter/prospectus, etc., or even a draft interview schedule). Through a process of peer review, we will work to improve each student's written work and to stay abreast of the diverse work being done in the field of the seminar's topic.
