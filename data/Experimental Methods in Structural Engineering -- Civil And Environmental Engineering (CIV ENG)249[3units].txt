Experimental Methods in Structural Engineering -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)249[3units]
Description: This course covers the following topics: similitude laws, design of structural models, instrumentation and measurement techniques; use of computers to acquire data and control tests; pseudo-dynamic testing method; standard proof-testing for capacity assessment; non-destructive testing for condition assessment, and virtual experimentation. Upon completing this course, the students will be able to use experimental methods to investigate the behavior of a structure and to evaluate its condition.
