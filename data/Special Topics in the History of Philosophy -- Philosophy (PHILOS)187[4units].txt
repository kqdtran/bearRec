Special Topics in the History of Philosophy -- Philosophy (PHILOS)187[4units]
Description: The course's specific content will vary from occasion to occasion but either the course will focus narrowly upon problems drawn from the work of a philosopher in the 160 to 178 series, or it will study several influential philosophers, active mainly before the twentieth century, who shared a common outlook or who were linked by other types of philosophically significant reaction to one another's work.
