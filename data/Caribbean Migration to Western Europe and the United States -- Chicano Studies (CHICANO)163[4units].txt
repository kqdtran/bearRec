Caribbean Migration to Western Europe and the United States -- Chicano Studies (CHICANO)163[4units]
Description: The main goal of this course is to offer a broad and comprehensive understanding of the Caribbean migration experience to the United States. We will cover crucial issues such as the migration origins, modes of incorporation, racism, cultural/identity strategies, and the political-economic relationship between the country of origin and the metropolitan host society. To understand the specificity of Caribbean migrants to the USA, it is fundamental to understand the regional Caribbean migration circuits to Western Europe. Thus, the course will provide a comparative perspective with Caribbean migrations to Western Europe.
