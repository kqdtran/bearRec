Introduction to Micro/Nano Mechanical Systems Laboratory -- Mechanical Engineering (MEC ENG)138[3units]
Description: This hands-on laboratory course focuses on the mechanical engineering principles that underlie the design, fabricaton, and operation of micro/nanoscale mechanical systems, including devices made by nanowire/nanotube syntheses; photolithography/soft lithography; and molding processes. Each laboratory will have different focuses for basic understanding of MEMS/NEMS systems from prototype constructions to experimental testings using mechanical, electrical, or optical techniques.
