African Theater and Performance -- Theater, Dance, And Performance Studies (THEATER)122[4units]
Description: African performance includes a wide range of vibrant forms: from scripted drama, theatre, dance, and music to oral traditions, storytelling, masquerading, and ritual. Using source materials that are neither "traditional" nor "modern," "African" nor "European," but a complex amalgamation of influences, African performances defy these limited but nevertheless tenacious dichotomies. In the performing arts, one sees the resilience and tenacity of African cultural forms as respositories of memory, sites of intercultural negotiation, and potent forums for political resistance.
