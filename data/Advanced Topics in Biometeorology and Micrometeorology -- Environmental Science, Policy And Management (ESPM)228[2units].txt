Advanced Topics in Biometeorology and Micrometeorology -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)228[2units]
Description: Measurement and modeling of trace gases and energy between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere. Micrometeorological flux measurement methods, including eddy covariance, profile, and eddy accumulation methods. A hierarchy of biophysical models are discussed for interpreting flux measurements. Information and theory on big-leaf, two-layer, and multi-layer models that couple energy, water, and carbon to predict trace gas fluxes are presented. How models integrate information from leaf to canopy to landscape scales is discussed.
