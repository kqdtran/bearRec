Biblical Poetry -- Near Eastern Studies (NE STUD)132[4units]
Description: A survey of the poetics and genres of poetry in the Hebrew Bible, focusing on close reading of selected texts. Theoretical issues will include the dynamics of parallelism, metaphor, intertextuality, agency, and gender. Historical issues will include the ancient Near Eastern literary genres and the political and ritual dynamics of the biblical poems. Throughout the course, we will also be reading selected modern poems that respond to biblical poetry. Primary texts will be largely drawn from the books of Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, and the prophets. All texts will be read in translation.
