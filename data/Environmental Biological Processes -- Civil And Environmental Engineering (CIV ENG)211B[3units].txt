Environmental Biological Processes -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)211B[3units]
Description: Fundamental concepts of biological processes that are important in natural and engineered environmental systems, especially those affecting water quality. Incorporates basic fundamentals of microbiology into a quantifiable engineering context to describe, predict, and control behavior of environmental biological systems. Topics include the stoichiometry, energetics and kinetics of microbial reactions, suspended and biofilm processes, carbon and nutrient cycling, and bioremediation applications.
