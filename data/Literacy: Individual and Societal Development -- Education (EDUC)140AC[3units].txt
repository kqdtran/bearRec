Literacy: Individual and Societal Development -- Education (EDUC)140AC[3units]
Description: This course combines theory and practice in the study of literacy and development. It will introduce sociocultural educational theory and research focused especially on literacy teaching and learning, and this literature will be examined in practice through participation in computer-based after-school programs. In addition, the course will contribute to understanding of race, culture, and ethnicity in the United States. We will develop a view of literacy, not as a neutral skill, but as embedded within culture and as depending for its meaning and its practice upon social institutions and conditions.
