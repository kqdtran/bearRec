Surface Water Hydrology -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)203N[3units]
Description: Course addresses topics of surface water hydrology, such as processes of water in the atmosphere, over land surface, and within soil; advanced representation and models for infiltration and evapotranspiration processes; partition of water and energy budgets at the land surface; snow and snowmelt processes; applications of remote sensing; flood and drought, and issues related to advanced hydrological modeling. Students will address practical problems and will learn how to use the current operational hydrologic forecasting model, and build hydrological models.
