Field Research: Participant Observation -- Sociology (SOCIOL)107B[5units]
Description: This course gives students both substantive background and practical training in the participant-observation method. The first semester will be classroom based to introduce the method. In the second semester students will put the method into practice as they are sent to the field to gather data for the Center for Urban Ethnography's Bay Area Study. During the fieldwork students will participate in a bi-weekly seminar and work under the guidance of the professor to address issues that arise in the field.
