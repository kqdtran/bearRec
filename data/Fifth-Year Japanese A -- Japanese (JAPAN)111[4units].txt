Fifth-Year Japanese A -- Japanese (JAPAN)111[4units]
Description: This course is designed for students who have studied Japanese for at least four years (540 hours). It aims to develop further their reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills so that they can utilize Japanese materials for research and job-related purposes, to present orally the results of their researches, and/or to pursue college-level courses taught in Japanese. Although much of class time will be devoted to reading- and writing-oriented activities, students are expected to participate actively in oral presentations, discussions, and debates in class.
