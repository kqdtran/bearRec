Social Aspects of Housing Design: Mid-Rise Urbanism -- Architecture (ARCH)217[3units]
Description: The course explores strategies to bring coherence and continuity back to the city focusing on mid-rise, higher density urbanism and the potential and difficulties of this scale of urban fabric to contribute to the form of cities, without losing the potential of choice and diversity. The seminars are organized in case studies revolving around four cities: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Beijing, and New York. Design exercises parallel the case studies as a way to test and challenge the potentials of mid-rise urbanism.
