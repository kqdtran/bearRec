The Berkeley Lectures on Energy: Energy from Biomass -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)C181[3units]
Description: After an introduction to the different aspects of our global energy consumption, the course will focus on the role of biomass. The course will illustrate how the global scale of energy guides the biomass research. Emphasis will be placed on the integration of the biological aspects (crop selection, harvesting, storage and distribution, and chemical composition of biomass) with the chemical aspects to convert biomass to energy. The course aims to engage students in state-of-the-art research. Also listed as Plant and Microbial Biology C124, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering C195A, and Chemistry C138.
