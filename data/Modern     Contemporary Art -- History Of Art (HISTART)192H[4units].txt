Modern/Contemporary Art -- History Of Art (HISTART)192H[4units]
Description: This undergraduate semiar examines the resurgence of craft within contemporary art and theory. In a time when much art is outsourced--fabricated by large stables of assistants--what does it mean when artists return to traditional, and traditionally laborious, methods of handiwork such as knitting, ceramics, or woodworking? Our readings will consider historical and theoretical questions of process, materiality, skill, bodily effort, gendered labor, and alternative economies of production.
