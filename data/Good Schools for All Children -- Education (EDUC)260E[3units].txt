Good Schools for All Children -- Education (EDUC)260E[3units]
Description: The course brings together three bodies of knowledge, developed by people who often work quite separately in the academy: philosophical discourses on the aims of education; research on effective schools and instruction; socio-cultural critiques of schooling inequities. Our quest in this course is to derive from these bodies of theory a conceptualization of the good school around the aims of performance, understanding, and justice.
