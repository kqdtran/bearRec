Stochastic Structural Dynamics -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)226[3units]
Description: Introduction to the theory of probability and random processes. Correlation and power spectral density functions. Stochastic dynamic analysis of single- and multi-degree-of-freedom structures subjected to stationary and non-stationary random excitations. Time- and frequency-domain analyses; modal cross-correlations. Response to multi-support excitations. Level crossings, envelope process, first-excursion probability, and distributions of peaks and extremes. Introduction to nonlinear stochastic dynamic analysis. Applications in earthquake, wind, and ocean engineering.
