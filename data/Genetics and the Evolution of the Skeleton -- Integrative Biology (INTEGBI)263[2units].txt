Genetics and the Evolution of the Skeleton -- Integrative Biology (INTEGBI)263[2units]
Description: In this seminar, we will explore the genetic underpinnings of vertebrate skeletal variation and review how such information is being incorporated into evolutionary and paleontological studies. Topics include quantitative genetic analyses of cranial variation and developmental genetics of the limb and dentition. This course will be tailored each semester to cover new research; therefore, students may enroll in this course multiple semesters.
