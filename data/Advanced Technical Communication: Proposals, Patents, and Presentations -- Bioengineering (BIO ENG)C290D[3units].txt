Advanced Technical Communication: Proposals, Patents, and Presentations -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)C290D[3units]
Description: This course will help the advanced Ph.D. student further develop critically important technical communication traits via a series of lectures, interactive workshops, and student projects that will address the structure and creation of effective research papers, technical reports, patents, proposals, business plans, and oral presentations. One key concept will be the emphasis on focus and clarity--achieved through critical thinking regarding objectives and context. Examples will be drawn primarily from health care and bioengineering multidisciplinary applications. Also listed as Mechanical Engineering C290X.
