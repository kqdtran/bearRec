Changing Forms in 20th-Century Dance -- Theater, Dance, And Performance Studies (THEATER)153B[3units]
Description: A chronological study of a large selection of works by 20th-century ballet, modern, and postmodern choreographers. We emphasize how dance reflects and affects political climate, social values, religious beliefs, and cultural constructions of gender by examining a variety of dance themes, movement vocabularies, and styles.
