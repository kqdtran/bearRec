Paradigmatic Didactical Mathematical Problematic Situations -- Education (EDUC)224B[3units]
Description: Paradigmatic Didactical Mathematical Problematic Situations are contexts for collaborative inquiry into the practice, epistemology, and pedagogy of mathematics.  Building on the Learning Sciences literature, the course creates opportunities for students to engage in interesting mathematical problems from secondary-school content.  Final projects include design, implementation, and analysis of a lesson.  Meets the "Discipline" programmatic requirement of graduate students in EMST and MACSME.
