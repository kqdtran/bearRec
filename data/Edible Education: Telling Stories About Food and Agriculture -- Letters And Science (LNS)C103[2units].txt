Edible Education: Telling Stories About Food and Agriculture -- Letters And Science (LNS)C103[2units]
Description: As the costs of our industrialized food system become impossible to ignore, a national debate over the future of food and farming has begun. Telling stories about where food comes from, how it is produced (and might be produced differently) plays a critical role in bringing attention to the issues and shifting politics. Each week a prominent figure in this debate explores what can be done to make the food system healthier more equitable, more sustainable, and the role of storytelling in the process. Also listed as Journalism C103.
