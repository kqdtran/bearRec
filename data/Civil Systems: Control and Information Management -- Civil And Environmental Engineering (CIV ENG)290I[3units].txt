Civil Systems: Control and Information Management -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)290I[3units]
Description: Mathematical methods and information technologies for controlling CEE systems. Emphasizes designing component organizations that interact with the world in real-time to control a large system. Methods applied to transportation operations, supply chains, and structures. Management of design complexity by hierarchical specification, systematic use of simulation and verification tools, semantics, polymorphism,information management services, and compilation from high-level design languages.
