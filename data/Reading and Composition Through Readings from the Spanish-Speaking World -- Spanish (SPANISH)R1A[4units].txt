Description: The course will offer students an introduction to the literature and culture of Spanish-speaking worlds, will help them develop their skills as readers and critical thinkers and make significant progress in their ability to write coherent, intellectually forceful expository prose. We will focus on analytical writing by developing control of argument and style. Essays will be produced through a process of workshop and revision, with in-class writing, homework, and peer commentary. Our guide will be Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace. Students meet together and also individually with the professor.
