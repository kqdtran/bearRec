Polymer Physics -- Chemical And Biomolecular Engineering (CHM ENG)295N[3units]
Description: This course, which is based on Gert Strobl's book The Physics of Polymers addresses the origin of some of the important physical properties of polymer liquids and solids. This includes phase transitions, crystallization, morphology of multiphase polymer systems, mechanical properties, response to mechanical and electric fields, and fracture. When possible, we will develop quantitative molecular models that predict macroscopic behavior. The course will address experimental data obtained by microscopy, light and neutron scattering, rheology, and dielectric relaxation.
