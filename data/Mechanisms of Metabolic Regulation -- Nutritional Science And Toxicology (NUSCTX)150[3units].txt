Mechanisms of Metabolic Regulation -- Nutritional Science And Toxicology (NUSCTX)150[3units]
Description: Principles of metabolic regulation in higher animals. Integration of metabolic paths and fluxes emphasizing experimental data and understanding mechanisms of nutrient affects. Advances in methods for studying metabolism, ranging from isotopic to molecular genetics techniques. This course provides the foundation for pursuing research in nutrient biochemistry/molecular biology, and for understanding nutrient and endocrine related diseases such as diabetes, birth defects, osteoporosis, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
