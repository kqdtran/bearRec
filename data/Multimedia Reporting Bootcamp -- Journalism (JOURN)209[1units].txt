Multimedia Reporting Bootcamp -- Journalism (JOURN)209[1units]
Description: This is a required one-week intensive multimedia training workshop at the beginning of the fall semester to equip all first-year graduate journalism students with basic knowledge of digital storytelling techniques as well as the use of multimedia equipment and editing software to produce multimedia content. The objective is to train all students regardless of their planned area of specialty with some foundational digital skills to be applied during their reporting for the school's local online news sites in the J200 Intro To Reporting class. The concepts and skills taught during the workshop also will be reaffirmed and expanded over the semester in the Multimedia Skills class.
