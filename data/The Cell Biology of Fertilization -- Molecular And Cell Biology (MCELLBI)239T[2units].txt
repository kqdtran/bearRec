The Cell Biology of Fertilization -- Molecular And Cell Biology (MCELLBI)239T[2units]
Description: Research in our lab is focused on the cell biology of mammalian fertilization. Our lab uses biophysical, biochemical, and molecular genetics methods to study sperm ion channels and transporters that regulate sperm motility, chemotaxis, and the acrosome reaction. A better understanding of these processes will eventually lead to the development of effective tools to control and preserve male fertility, improve the reproductive health of human population worldwide, and advance family planning.
