Logistics Network Design and Supply Chain Management -- Industrial Engineering (IND ENG)153[3units]
Description: We will focus primarily on both quantitative and qualitative issues which arise in the integrated design and management of the entire logistics network. Models and solution techniques for facility location and logistics network design will be considered. In addition, qualitative issues in distribution network structuring, centralized versus decentralized network control, variability in the supply chain, strategic partnerships, and product design for logistics will be considered through discussions and cases.
