Properties of Dielectric and Magnetic Materials -- Materials Science And Engineering (MAT SCI)117[3units]
Description: Introduction to the physical principles underlying the dielectric and magnetic properties of solids. Processing-microstructure-property relationships of dielectric materials, including piezoelectric, pryoelectric, and ferroelectric oxides, and of magnetic materials, including hard- and soft ferromagnets, ferrites and magneto-optic and -resistive materials. The course also covers the properties of grain boundary devices (including varistors) as well as ion-conducting and mixed conducting materials for applications in various devices such as sensors, fuel cells, and electric batteries.
