Mathematical Thinking and Problem Solving -- Education (EDUC)224A[3units]
Description: This course explores contemporary research on mathematical cognition, with a particular emphasis on "higher order thinking skills" and mathematical problem solving. We discuss various frameworks for characterizing mathematical behavior and various methodologies for examining it. As an "action oriented" course in the EMST curricular sequence, this course includes a major course project. In their project, students engage in research incorporating the main ideas studied in the course.
