Cultural Sources of Dance, Rhythm, and Movement -- Physical Education (PHYS ED)60[3units]
Description: This course examines the many roles that dance plays in various cultures around the world. Students will explore dance with respect to folklore, religion, sociology, geography, body types, and lifestyles. Dances for birth, death, marriage, war, harvest, religion, and pleasure will be dissected, discussed, and related back to society. The course material will also bring focus to ideas pertaining to American culture and the use of the body in art and contemporary society. Bi-weekly lectures will identify how and why humans dance, and why certain rhythms and movements are inherent to each culture. In conjunction with lectures will be a two-hour laboratory where students will personally experience movement styles, rhythms, and sounds of the world. No prior dance experience needed.
