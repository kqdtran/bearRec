The Benevolent Asylum -- Social Welfare (SOC WEL)237[2units]
Description: Supervised residential care provision, for a variety of reasons, has been much maligned during the last 50 years. Yet for many, residential placement has served as a source of stability and quality care. This course will consider the history of residential care provision and development, financing and design issues, including group responses to various aspects of the residential environment such as size, architecture, community access, supervision, etc. Using an evidence-based approach to residential care, the course will consider setting objectives, special population needs, and person-environment fit. This course will look at the pros and cons of group, institutional or residential placement from a value-based and from an empirical perspective. It will involve substantial use of international materials. The course will consider the theory and practice of residential care for a broad range of populations. It will provide the essentials necessary to enable students to develop and design benevolent asylums.
