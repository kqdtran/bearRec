Introduction to Convex Optimization -- Industrial Engineering (IND ENG)C227A[4units]
Description: Convex optimization is a class of nonlinear optimization problems where the objectives to be minimized, and the constraints, are both convex. Contrary to the more classical linear programming framework, convex programs often go unrecognized, and this is a pity since a large class of convex optimization problems can now be efficiently solved. In addition, it is possible to address hard, non-convex problems (such as "combinatorial optimization" problems) using convex approximations that are more efficient than classical linear ones. The course covers some convex optimization theory and algorithms, and describes various applications arising in engineering design, machine learning and statistics, finance, and operations research. The course includes laboratory assignments, which consist of hands-on experience. Also listed as Electrical Engineering C227A.
