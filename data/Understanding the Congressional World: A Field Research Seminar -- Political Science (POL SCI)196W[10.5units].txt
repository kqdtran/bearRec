Understanding the Congressional World: A Field Research Seminar -- Political Science (POL SCI)196W[10.5units]
Description: This research seminar will explore the workings of Congress and its role in making public policy. It combines elective coursework with the original scholarship requirements of a UCDC research seminar and is designed for students in Congressional internships and those considering Congressional staff positions after graduation. In addition to studying the pathways of lawmaking, we will ask how Congress and its Members relate to the other branches of government, the press, and the public.
