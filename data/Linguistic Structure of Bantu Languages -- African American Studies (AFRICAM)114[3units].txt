Linguistic Structure of Bantu Languages -- African American Studies (AFRICAM)114[3units]
Description: The objective of this course is to examine the major syntactic structures of Bantu languages with comments on the contributions made by African linguistics to general linguistics. Chichewa, also known as Chinyanja, a language spoken in east, central, and southern Africa, as well as Swahili, the major language of East Africa, and Ndebele or Zulu, languages of southern Africa, will constitute the main case studies. Data from those and other languages will be brought in to illustrate relevant aspects of Bantu linguistic structure.
