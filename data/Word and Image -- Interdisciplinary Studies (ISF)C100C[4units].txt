Word and Image -- Interdisciplinary Studies (ISF)C100C[4units]
Description: This course is designed to sharpen our skills in understanding what happens when the world of images and words meet. Starting with the work from the Western "classical" tradition we will proceed to investigate how word/image constellations operate in a variety of media, including sculpture and poetry, painting and prose, death masks, tableaux vivants, photography, and advertising. Also listed as Scandinavian C114.
