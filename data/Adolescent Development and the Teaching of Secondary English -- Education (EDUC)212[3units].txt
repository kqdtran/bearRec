Adolescent Development and the Teaching of Secondary English -- Education (EDUC)212[3units]
Description: This graduate seminar relates the goals of secondary English teaching to three major themes in the study of adolescent development: rationality, morality, and identity. These themes are then explored with reference to urban youth, along with other themes emerging from research in urban settings. The theme of identity is pursued further through a consideration of adolescents' "self-theories" and their motivational consequences. Students write papers on related topics for a class anthology.
