Cuba, the United States and Cuban Americans -- Chicano Studies (CHICANO)165[4units]
Description: This course examines the contested formation of Cuban identity, where the questions of race and the relationship to the United States have constituted fundamental issues in the debate over the meaning of Cubanidad. The course will address the ways in which Cuba dealt with the issue of race and national identity after the revolution of 1959, as well as, for the Cuban emigre community in the United States. Issues of gender, class, and cultural expression will be crucial elements of analysis throughout the course.
