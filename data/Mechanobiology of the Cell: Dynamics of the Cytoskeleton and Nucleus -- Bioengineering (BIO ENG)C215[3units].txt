Mechanobiology of the Cell: Dynamics of the Cytoskeleton and Nucleus -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)C215[3units]
Description: This course develops and applies scaling laws and the methods of continuum and statistical mechanics to understand micro- and nano-scale mechanobiological phenomena involved in the living cell with particular attention the nucleus and the cytoskelton as well as the interactions of the cell with the extracellular matrix and how these interactions may cause changes in cell architecture and biology, consequently leading to functional adaptation or pathological conditions. Also listed as Mechanical Engineering C216.
