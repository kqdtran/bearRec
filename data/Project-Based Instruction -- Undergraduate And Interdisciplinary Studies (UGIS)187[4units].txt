Project-Based Instruction -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)187[4units]
Description: Framed around the topic of sustainability, the course engages students from different math, science, and engineering majors in the process of applying the content knowledge from their discipline to build project-based curricula for presentation as part of a 45-hour field placement in a local high school classroom. Students develop pedagogical content knowledge and relate teaching theory to practice through readings, classroom activities, discussion, lesson planning, and field observations.
