Structure Analysis by X-Ray Diffraction -- Chemistry (Department Of) (CHEM)208[4units]
Description: The theory and practice of modern, single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Groups of four students determine the crystal and molecular structure of newly synthesized materials from the College of Chemistry. The laboratory work involves the mounting of crystals and initial evaluation by X-ray diffraction film techniques, the collection of intensity data by automated diffractometer procedures, and structure analysis and refinement.
