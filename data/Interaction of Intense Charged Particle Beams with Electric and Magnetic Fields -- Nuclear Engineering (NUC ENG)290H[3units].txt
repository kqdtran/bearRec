Interaction of Intense Charged Particle Beams with Electric and Magnetic Fields -- Nuclear Engineering (NUC ENG)290H[3units]
Description: Comprehensive introduction to charged particle accelerator systems with high space charge intensity. Provides a foundation for research and design of systems with intensities sufficiently high so that mutual interactions of the particles in a beam focused and accelerated by applied electric and magnetic fields can not be neglected. Methodologies systematically developed by applying dynamics, electromagnetic theory, and plasma physics. Appropriate for students in engineering and physics.
