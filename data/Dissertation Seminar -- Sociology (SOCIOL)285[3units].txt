Dissertation Seminar -- Sociology (SOCIOL)285[3units]
Description: The seminar is a forum for intensive attention to writing of seminar members at any stage, from initial planning of the dissertation to the job presentation talk. We will be especially concerned with reflexive issues: the choice of problem and method as a sociological, political, personal, and market issue; the place of the researcher in research; sociology as a discipline and interdiscipline. Problems of organization, scope, theoretical and empirical emphasis will also be addressed.
