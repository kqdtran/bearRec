Gender Matters in 20th Century America -- History (HISTORY)136AC[4units]
Description: This course explores the social, political, cultural, and economic history of women and men's lives, as well as changing sexual attitudes toward gender, the family and sexuality. Against the tapestry of twentieth century American history, we will analyze how two dramatic changes -- women's entry into the paid labor force and their control over their reproductive lives -- gave rise to our contemporary cultural wars over the family, sexuality, and reproduction.
