Analysis of Contemporary China -- Political Science (POL SCI)244A[4units]
Description: This is the first in a two-semester sequence designed to provide the incoming graduate student with a basic grounding in the politics of contemporary China. The focus will be on wide reading and comprehension of the available analytical literature; its sequel will be devoted to integrating that reading with primary source research materials. There are no prerequisites, though undergraduate course work in Chinese politics and/or some acquaintance with the Chinese language would be useful.
