Experiential Advanced Control Design I -- Electrical Engineering (EL ENG)C220B[3units]
Description: Experience-based learning in the design of SISO and MIMO feedback controllers for linear systems. The student will master skills needed to apply linear control design and analysis tools to classical and modern control problems. In particular, the participant will be exposed to and develop expertise in two key control design technologies: frequency-domain control synthesis and time-domain optimization-based approach. Also listed as Mechanical Engineering C231A.
