Approaches to Chinese Politics -- Political Science (POL SCI)244C[4units]
Description: This course has three main objectives: to expose students to debates in the study of post-1949 Chinese politics; to consider how research on contemporary China both draws from and informs political science; and to explore characterizations of the Chinese state and state-society relations. Emphasis on questions such as: What can we learn by examining Chinese culture and institutions? Do concepts such as fragmented authoritarianism, neotraditionalism, state "reach," civil society, and corporatism produce insights into the structure and dynamics of Chinese politics?
