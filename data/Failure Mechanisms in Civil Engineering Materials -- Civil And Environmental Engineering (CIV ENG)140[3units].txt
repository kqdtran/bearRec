Failure Mechanisms in Civil Engineering Materials -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)140[3units]
Description: The failure mechanisms in civil engineering materials (cement-based materials, metallic- and polymer-based materials) are associated with processing, microstructure, stress states, and environmental changes. Fracture mechanics of brittle, quasi-brittle, and ductile materials; cracking processes in monolithic, particulate, and fiber reinforced materials; examples of ductile/brittle failure transitions in civil engineering structures; retrofitting of existing structures; non-destructive techniques for damage detection.
