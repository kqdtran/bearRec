Introduction to Comparative Virology -- Plant And Microbial Biology (PLANTBI)C114[4units]
Description: This course will provide a comparative overview of virus life cycles and strategies viruses use to infect and replicate in hosts. We will discuss virus structure and classification and the molecular basis of viral reproduction, evolution, assembly, and virus-host interactions. Common features used during virus replication and host cellular responses to infection will be covered. Topics also included are common and emerging virus diseases, their control, and factors affecting their spread. Also listed as Environ Sci, Policy, and Management C138 and Molecular and Cell Biology C114.
