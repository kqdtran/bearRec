Globalization and International Education -- Education (EDUC)285[3units]
Description: What is globalization? What are the implications of living in a "global world" for educational systems? In this course, we explore these questions by first examining various theoretical perspectives on globalization. We will then discuss several major developments associated with globalization that are affecting different levels of education (from primary to university) including the rise in accountability and testing, skills for the "knowledge" economy, and immigration. We will consider the role of international organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nations in shaping international policy and programs. We will also examine the role that the state, local communities, and non-governmental agencies play in providing and improving the quality of education. In the final part of the course, we examine topics including language policy, technology, and strategies to combat educational inequality. To explore these topics, we will read and discuss case studies from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the United States to provide concrete examples of how global forces are changing the context and content of education internationally.
