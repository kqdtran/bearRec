Wonder and the Fantastic: The Thousand and One Nights in World Literary Imagination -- Near Eastern Studies (NE STUD)155[3units]
Description: After studying the tales themselves and examining their structure and how they fit into the genre of folk literature, we will investigate how the Nights was transmitted, translated, and received in Europe, as a window on 19th-century gender and racial attitudes, especially Western views of the "oriental" other. How the Nights was creatively manipulated by Western writers will be studied, as will the influence of these tales on modern Arabic literature itself. Several examples of how the Nights have been represented in Western films will be considered. All works will be read in English translation.
