Narrative and Medicine -- Health And Medical Sciences Program (HMEDSCI)211[1units]
Description: This course's goal is to provide a method for medical students to think, write about, and discuss feelings engendered by clinical encounters. Medical students are taught the need to be emotionally detached from patients, yet being emotionally detached does not mean devoid of emotion. This course offers a means to express and analyze those feelings. Also considered is the value of regarding the medical history as "text" which can be written and read from differing, equally valid viewpoints.
