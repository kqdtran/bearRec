Writing, Visuality, and the Powers of Images -- East Asian Languages And Cultures (EA LANG)103[4units]
Description: This course examines how fictional and historical texts from Asia and the West explore beliefs in the powers of images and their implication in questions of knowledge and power, the borders of life and death, and the politics of gender, history, memory, and culture. We'll track how such beliefs change, persist, and are re-appropriated across historical time and cultural space, and consider the critical light "premodern" texts from our "modern" world of images project upon each other.
