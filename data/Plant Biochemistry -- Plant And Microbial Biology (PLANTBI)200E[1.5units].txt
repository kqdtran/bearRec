Plant Biochemistry -- Plant And Microbial Biology (PLANTBI)200E[1.5units]
Description: The aim of this course is to augment the student's knowledge of key plant-specific (or particularly relevant) biochemical processes focusing on the underlying experiments used to deduce key cycles coupled with current areas of exploration and debate surrounding a given topic area. In addition, this section will broaden and deepen the student's knowledge of biochemistry in general including basic enzyme kinetics, assessment of enzymatic (biochemical) function, and modes of regulation.
