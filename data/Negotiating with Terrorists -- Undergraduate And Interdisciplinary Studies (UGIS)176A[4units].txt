Negotiating with Terrorists -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)176A[4units]
Description: This course will serve to teach and discuss the topic "Negotiating with Terrorists." The focus will be on negotiations with collective terrorist movements, not on bargaining with hostage takers in the course of single-event hostage taking incidences. The course will be organized in four thematic blocks with three classes each. All of the classes will be based on working on analytic themes. During classes, case studies will be equally discussed to foster understanding of these matters.
