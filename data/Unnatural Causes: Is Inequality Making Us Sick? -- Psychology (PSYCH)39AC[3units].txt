Unnatural Causes: Is Inequality Making Us Sick? -- Psychology (PSYCH)39AC[3units]
Description: This interdisciplinary seminar will explore the large and disturbing socio-economic and racial/ethnic disparities in health...and search for their causes. The social circumstances in which we are born, live, and work become 'biologically embedded' and put us at a risk for stroke, heart disease, poor mental health, and academic achievement. This seminar will explore why some populations get sicker more often in the first place, i.e. the role of inequality, racism, and neglect in breeding disease.
