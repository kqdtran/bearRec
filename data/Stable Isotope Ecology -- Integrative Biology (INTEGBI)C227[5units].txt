Stable Isotope Ecology -- Integrative Biology (INTEGBI)C227[5units]
Description: Course focuses on principles and applications of stable isotope chemistry as applied to the broad science of ecology. Lecture topics include principles of isotope behavior and chemistry, and isotope measurements in the context of terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecological processes and problems. Students participate in a set of laboratory exercises involving preparation of samples of choice for isotopic analyses, the use of the mass spectrometer and optical analysis systems, and the anlaysis of data. Also listed as Earth and Planetary Science C241 and Environ Sci, Policy, and Management C220.
