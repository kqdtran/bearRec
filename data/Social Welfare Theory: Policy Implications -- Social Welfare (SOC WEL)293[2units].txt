Description: The course deals primarily with macro-theories of a sociological and political-economy nature that offer 1) conceptual representations of welfare systems, 2) explanations of the dynamics and functions of welfare systems, and 3) analyses and assessments of the different normative perspectives that inform policy making in social welfare.
