Using Cuneiform Texts in Research -- Near Eastern Studies (NE STUD)205[3units]
Description: This seminar is meant for graduate students who wish to use cuneiform texts (in original or in translation) for their research. The most general question that we will ask is: how does a text produce meaningful information? The seminar is organized around three tasks: evaluation of secondary literature, methodological reflection on the use of texts, and using cuneiform texts in a scholarly paper.
