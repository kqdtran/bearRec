Biomechanics -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)102[4units]
Description: This course introduces, develops, and applies scaling laws and the methods of continuum mechanics to tissue-level biomechanical phenomena. It is intended for upper level undergraduate students who have been exposed to vectors and tensors, differential equations, and undergraduate courses in either fluids or transport, and molecular biology. Topics include biosolid and biofluid mechanics; elastic (time-independent), viscoelastic, and poroelastic (time-dependent) behavior of tissues; continuum and microstructural models; constitutive laws; material properties of tissues; experimental methods--macroscopic rheology.
