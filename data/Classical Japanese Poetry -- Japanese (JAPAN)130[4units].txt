Classical Japanese Poetry -- Japanese (JAPAN)130[4units]
Description: An introduction to the critical analysis and translation of traditional Japanese poetry, a genre that reaches from early declarative work redolent of an even earlier oral tradition to medieval and Early Modern verses evoking exquisitely differentiated emotional states via complex rhetoric and literary allusion. Topics may include the poetry of the Man'yoshu, Kokinshu, and Shinkokinshu poetic anthologies, linked verse (renga), and the haikai of Basho and other Early modern poets.
