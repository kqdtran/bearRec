American Indian History: Precontact to the Present -- History (HISTORY)135[4units]
Description: This course will provide an introductory interpretation of the varied historical experiences of diverse nations native to North America from their origins through the present. We will assess both the impact of colonialism and its consequences upon Indian peoples as well as their responses, treating Native Americans as historical, political, economic, and cultural actors who resourcefully adjusted, resisted, and accommodated to the changing realities of life in native North America.
