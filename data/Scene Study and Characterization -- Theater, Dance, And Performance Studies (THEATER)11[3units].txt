Scene Study and Characterization -- Theater, Dance, And Performance Studies (THEATER)11[3units]
Description: In this course the emphasis of the students' studies shifts from the development of basic skills to the development of skills necessary to the character actor. Students develop characterizations which lie outside their personal experience by performing characters who are not close to themselves in age or background. Students continue to employ the basic acting and vocal techniques introduced in 10.
