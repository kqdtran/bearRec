Introduction to Nano-Biology -- Mechanical Engineering (MEC ENG)290L[3units]
Description: This course introduces graduate students in Mechanical Engineering to the nascent field of Nano-Biology. The course is comprised of both formal lectures and projects. Lectures will include an introduction to both molecular biology (components of cells, protein structure and function, DNA, gene regulation, etc.) and nanotechnology ("bottom up" and "top down" nanotechnologies), an overview of current instrumentation in biology, an in-depth description of the recent integration of molecular biology with nanotechnology (for sensing or labeling purposes, elucidating information on cells, etc.), and an introduction to Systems Biology (design principles of biological circuits). Students will read and present a variety of current journal papers to the class and lead a discussion on the various works.
