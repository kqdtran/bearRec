Optimization Models in Finance -- Master'S In Financial Engineering (MFE)230P[2units]
Description: This course proposes a guided tour through optimization models arising in practical finance. These problems include ones that are traditionally associated with optimization, including asset and liability management, asset pricing, and portfolio optimization. We also describe optimization models arising in model calibration, predication and estimation, and risk analysis. The course includes some recent approaches to the analysis of other kinds of financial data, such as text (financial news) data.
