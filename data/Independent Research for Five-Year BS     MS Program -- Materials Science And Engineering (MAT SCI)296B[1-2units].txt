Independent Research for Five-Year BS/MS Program -- Materials Science And Engineering (MAT SCI)296B[1-2units]
Description: This is the second semester of a two-course sequence for those majors in the five year BS/MS program. Students are expected to complete an independent research project under the supervision of a research advisor initiated in Materials Science and Engineering 296A. This course will meet once at the beginning of the semester to outline the expectations of the course. Periodic meetings covering topics such as data analysis and design of experiment will be scheduled. Students will be expected to keep a laboratory notebook outlining their progress during the semester. A final report in journal publication form will be due at the end of the semester. Each student will also give a final presentation on his/her research project at the end of the semester.
