Dissertation Writing Workshop -- Near Eastern Studies (NE STUD)291[4units]
Description: A faculty member will oversee the group, offering guidance and making sure guidelines are followed. Students will manage the group's day-to-day operations. At least one week before each meeting a student will pre-circulate a draft of a chapter. During the meeting, students will give feedback on the draft. This feedback will be used to revise the chapter, which will be due at the end of the semester. The workshop is open to graduate students from other departments who are writing on topics associated with Near Eastern Studies.
