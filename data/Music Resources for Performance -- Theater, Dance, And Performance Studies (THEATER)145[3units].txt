Music Resources for Performance -- Theater, Dance, And Performance Studies (THEATER)145[3units]
Description: This course is an introduction to the sonic poetry of gesture. Studying historical Eurocentric precedents and current trends in theatrical/dance music, we will examine the work of composers for early royal theater like Rameau; move to the program of music of composers like Tchaikovsky; look at pre-electronic composers like Varese, Berio, and Stockhausen; shift into the avant-garde with Cage; and study contemporary composers like Anderson. Discussions will be based on lectures and readings. An important aspect of this course is the practical experience and analysis of sonic experimentation in performance.
