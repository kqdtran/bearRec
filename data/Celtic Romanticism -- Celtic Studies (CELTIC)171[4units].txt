Celtic Romanticism -- Celtic Studies (CELTIC)171[4units]
Description: From the Classical age to the 21st century, Celts have fascinated people. This course explores the different ways in which Celtic peoples have been perceived by outsiders, and the ways in which Celts have presented themselves to the world. The recurring themes of freedom and independence, as well as the warrior and druid types, are stressed. The course also explores the ways in which the Romantic idealizations of Celts have been appropriated by native nationalist political movements and by European imperialist ventures. All readings in English.
