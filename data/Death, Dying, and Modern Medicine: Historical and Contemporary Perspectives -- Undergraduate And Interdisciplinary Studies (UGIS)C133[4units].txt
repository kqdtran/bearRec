Death, Dying, and Modern Medicine: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)C133[4units]
Description: This course will study the end of life--dying and death--from the perspective of medicine and history. It seeks to confront the humanist with the quotidian dilemmas of modern clinical practice and medicine's deep engagement with death more generally. It invites pre-med, pre-law, and public policy students to understand these matters in light of the historical and, more broadly, literary and artistic perspectives of the humanities. Also listed as History C191 and Health and Medical Sciences C133.
