History of the Civil Rights Movement -- African American Studies (AFRICAM)125[4units]
Description: The objective of this course is to examine the modern civil rights movement. As understood traditionally, this period began with the United States Supreme Court decision of May 17, 1954, Brown vs. Board of Education, until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This course will seek to place this movement in the context of global developments and in the context of the broad sweep of United States history. Assigned readings consist of historical texts and autobiographies. Lectures will place the readings in context, discussing the material and its significance in the overall history and culture of African Americans. Visual and musical media will augment the class lectures.
