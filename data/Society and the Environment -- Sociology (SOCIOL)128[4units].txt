Society and the Environment -- Sociology (SOCIOL)128[4units]
Description: Living in an urban area at the end of the 20th century, it is easy to forget how germane the biophysical world is to our lives. This course seeks to explore the relationships between society and the environment as they have varied over time and across societies. The approach taken will be broadly historical and multicultural and will include readings on the social construction of nature, early industrialization and natural resource use, social movements and the environment, and the environmental impacts of late capitalism.
