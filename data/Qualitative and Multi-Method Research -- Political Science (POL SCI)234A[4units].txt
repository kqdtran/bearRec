Qualitative and Multi-Method Research -- Political Science (POL SCI)234A[4units]
Description: This course introduces diverse methodological tools, following the premise that all methods are strengthened if linked to qualitative analysis. Explores alternative approaches to concept formation, measurement, and causal inference, based on large- and small-N analysis and case studies. Analytic tensions that motivate the course derive from, among other sources, the pressure on case-study and small-N researchers to strive for analytic rigor and generality; and the skepticism of some statisticians about quantitative inference - both descriptive and casual - in social science.
