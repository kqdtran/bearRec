Social and Behavioral Health Research: Introduction to Survey Methods -- Public Health (PB HLTH)219D[3units]
Description: This course provides students with a thorough tool kit for designing survey questionnaires and for implementing telephone, face-to-face, and mail surveys. The three-hour weekly class sessions are designed to convey practical knowledge, with a case study approach used to complement each topical lecture. An SPSS laboratory is also given each semester. The course is an elective for Health and Social Behavior students, and many from the multidisciplinary program and other tracks in the school (including UCSF, e.g., nurses in their Ph.D. programs) have often enrolled as well. By the end of the semester, students will have designed, as their class project, a research project including a study design rationale, aims and hypotheses, data collection methods and measures, human subjects consent form, codebook and analysis plan.
