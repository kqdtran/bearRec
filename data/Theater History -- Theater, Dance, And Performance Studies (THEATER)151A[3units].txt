Theater History -- Theater, Dance, And Performance Studies (THEATER)151A[3units]
Description: A chronological survey of world theater to 1800, this course begins with an investigation of "performance behavior"--the human impulse to organize complex games, rituals, and other display activities. It explores the mythological and historical origins of theater in various cultures as well as the derivation of the first dramatic scripts. A heavy emphasis is placed on the analysis of the "promptbooks" and visual sources of early European and Asian theaters for a practical understanding of their scenic and acting styles.
