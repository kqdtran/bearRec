Discourse and Learning in Math and Science Classrooms -- Education (EDUC)229D[3units]
Description: This seminar is an introduction to research on how language and other forms of communication influence what and how people learn. Students are introduced to influential theories of discourse from sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and the philosophy of language and learn about how they have been used to understand learning, especially in math and science classrooms. Students take turns helping lead discussion and complete a project relevant to the topic and their own research interests.
