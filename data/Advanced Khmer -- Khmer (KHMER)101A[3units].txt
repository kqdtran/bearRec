Advanced Khmer -- Khmer (KHMER)101A[3units]
Description: This course continues the themes and goals of 100B. Students will focus on the same broad topics covered in Intermediate Khmer--religion, traditional culture, and the language of public information (news and advertising)--but they will learn more advanced vocabulary and grammatical structures necessary for the discussion of these topics with educated native speakers, and read more advanced texts dealing with these topics than the Intermediate students. Additional material beyond the Intermediate curriculum includes reading and analyzing historical folk tales, learning to discuss the rice-farming cycle, and acquiring the tools to discuss research and "development" work in Cambodia at a sophisticated level.
