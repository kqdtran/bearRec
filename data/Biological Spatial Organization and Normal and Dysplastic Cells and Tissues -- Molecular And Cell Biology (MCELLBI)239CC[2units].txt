Biological Spatial Organization and Normal and Dysplastic Cells and Tissues -- Molecular And Cell Biology (MCELLBI)239CC[2units]
Description: Our biophysics laboratory is focused on two intersecting research directions: (I) exploration of biological spatial organization on the mesoscale (10nm-10microns) and (II) characterization of the mechanics of normal and dysplastic cells and tissues. We also invent and refine tools for precision control and characterization of cells and tissues.
