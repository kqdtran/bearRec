Photography Tutorial -- Journalism (JOURN)214[2-3units]
Description: This photo tutorial will emphasize the technical aspects in photography such as darkroom skills, lighting, cropping, composition, editing, and presentation. Students will be working on weekly assignments as well as a final project that would directly correlate with the material covered in class as well as to the courses taught by Ken Light. The tutorial will encourage students to explore the darkroom and to improve not only their conceptual understanding of the medium, but especially their technical, shooting, and printing, knowledge of photography. Several Photoshop tutorials will also be incorporated in the class for those students who are interested in learning digital photography and its possibilities. The sessions will cover scanning, resolution, and tools applicable to image manipulation, color correction, and output. The Photography Tutorial and its content will be, of course, to a large extent determined by the questions raised by students, their levels of experience in the medium, as well as their final goals.
