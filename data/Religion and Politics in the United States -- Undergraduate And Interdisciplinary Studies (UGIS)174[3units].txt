Religion and Politics in the United States -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)174[3units]
Description: Thomas Jefferson said that there should be a "wall of separation" between religion and the state in order to protect each. Nonetheless, throughout U.S. history, religion, politics and government have been mixed together in a variety of ways. And there is no doubt that religion has been a powerful motivator of U.S. citizens to engage in political action (e.g., the temperance movement, the civil rights movement, anti-abortion activism). This course will explore the delicate and controversial mix of religion and politics in the U.S. with a strong emphasis on the modern era. Topics include the proper role of religion in politics, the impact of religion on public policy, the rise of the religious right movement, and the impact of the religion factor on electoral behavior.
