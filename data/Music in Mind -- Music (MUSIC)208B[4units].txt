Music in Mind -- Music (MUSIC)208B[4units]
Description: Research seminar dealing with "what goes on in your mind" when you make music. Topics include conceptualization, processes of learning, retention, and recall. In the context of interaction among musicians, variation and other forms of alteration (from relatively free improvisation to formulaic recomposition) with varing degrees of intentionality manifested in performances will be considered. Perception is implicated, but not a central issue.
