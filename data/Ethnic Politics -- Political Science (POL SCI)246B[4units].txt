Ethnic Politics -- Political Science (POL SCI)246B[4units]
Description: This graduate seminar is designed to introduce students to the comparative study of ethnic politics. It provides an overview of theoretical questions and methodological innovations across five topics: the conceptualization and measurement of ethnicity; the sources of ethnic mobilization and cleavage choice; the consequences of ethnic mobilization for democratization and democracy; the impact of ethnicity on redistributive politics; and the relationship between ethnicity and patterns of violence ranging from urban riots to civil wars. Readings for each topic are drawn from various political science subfields as well as from other disciplines. They also reflect a range of regional contexts, including Eastern Europe, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of the course is to provide graduate students with a basis for undertaking their own original research on questions relating to ethnic politics. It should enable them to critically engage recent scholarship, understanding which theories have yet to be adequately tested and which theoretically interesting questions have yet to be asked.
