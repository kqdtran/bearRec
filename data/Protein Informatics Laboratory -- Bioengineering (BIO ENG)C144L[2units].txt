Protein Informatics Laboratory -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)C144L[2units]
Description: This course is intended to introduce students to a variety of bioinformatics techniques that are used to predict protein function and structure. It is designed to be taken concurrently with C144 (which provides the theoretical foundations for the methods used in the laboratory class), although students can petition to take this laboratory course separately. No programming is performed in this class, and no prior programming experience is required. Also listed as Plant and Microbial Biology C144L.
