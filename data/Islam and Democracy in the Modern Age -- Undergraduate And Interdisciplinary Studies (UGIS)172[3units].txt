Islam and Democracy in the Modern Age -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)172[3units]
Description: This course will primarily undertake to explore democratic notions in Islamic tradition that could provide a legal base for political legitimacy, but that either have not been institutionalized, or have disappeared over the course of history. The course then studies Muslim societies in modern times to find out how these Islamic democratic notions have been influenced by Modern circumstances and incorporated in Muslim political systems. It then turns to the pluralistic interpretations of Islam that have, since the beginning of the 20th century, tried to adapt democratic institutions to Islamic values. Closely related to this issue, it also studies the new round of hermeneutical readings of the religious texts, which emerged beginning in the 1980's, some of which propose a minimalist role for the apparent meanings of the texts. Finally, the course will survey challenges to the above-mentioned recent trends brought by traditional thinkers for whom the free interpretation of the religious texts would weaken the faith and add to the present confusion in understanding Islam.
