Applied Spectroscopy -- Chemical And Biomolecular Engineering (CHM ENG)C295R[3units]
Description: After a brief review of quantum mechanics and semi-classical theories for the interaction of radiation with matter, this course will survey the various spectroscopies associated with the electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma rays to radio waves. Special emphasis is placed on application to research problems in applied and engineering sciences. Graduate researchers interested in systematic in situ process characterization, analysis, or discovery are best served by this course. Also listed as Applied Science and Technology C295R.
