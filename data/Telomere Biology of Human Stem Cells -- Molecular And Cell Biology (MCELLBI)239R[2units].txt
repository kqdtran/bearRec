Telomere Biology of Human Stem Cells -- Molecular And Cell Biology (MCELLBI)239R[2units]
Description: The goal of our laboratory is to understand the key functions of telomeres and telomerase in tissue homeostasis, tumorigenesis, and aging. To this end, we generate genetically engineered human pluripotent and adult stem cell models to measure telomere and telomerase function during cellular differentiation and tumor formation.
