Cities and the Country -- Chinese (CHINESE)159[4units]
Description: This course explores one of the most central and potent areas of cultural politics in modern China: the city and its relations to the countryside. We will explore how urban space and native soil became central places of imagination and desire in modernity; how Beijing and Shanghai become mediums of imagining differing meanings of "modernity" and "tradition," "Chinese" and "Western," and cultural authenticity; the repeated reformist and revolutionary desire to return from the city back to the countryside; as well as more recent mass migrations from the countryside during a time of (and as part of) drastic urban destruction and "renewal." Throughout the course, we will examine fiction, essays, photographs, films, and theoretical writings in order to consider a variety of ways in which people have sought to picture or narrate the shifting relations of cities and country.
