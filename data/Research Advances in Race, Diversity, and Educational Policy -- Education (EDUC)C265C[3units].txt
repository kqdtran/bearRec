Research Advances in Race, Diversity, and Educational Policy -- Education (EDUC)C265C[3units]
Description: This introductory graduate seminar will engage the research literature on race, diversity, and educational policy to provide a foundation for examining contemporary issues in American public schooling. We will examine research on race, culture, and learning alongside more policy driven research on school structures, governance, finance, politics, and policy. In doing so, we will blend micro level examinations of teaching and learning with macro level considerations of politics and policy. Also listed as African American Studies C265.
