Health Workforce and Public Policy -- Public Health (PB HLTH)220F[2units]
Description: This course focuses on three interrelated issues: How do we determine when we have too many or too few health care workers to provide high quality and cost effective care? What are the factors that determine the supply and distribution of health care workers? What are the methods that can be used to increase the performance and productivity of health care workers? We will review recent evidence on the supply, quality, and cost of the health workforce in California, the U.S., and globally. Approaches to the public and private financing of medical education will also be analyzed. This course is taught in a seminar format with lectures, visiting speakers, and student presentations.
