California Water: An Interdisciplinary Seminar -- Landscape Architecture And Environmental Planning (LD ARCH)258[1units]
Description: This seminar studies California water issues from an interdisciplinary perspective, building upon the established California Colloquium on Water, to increase understanding and appreciation of water resources and contribute to informed decision-making about water in California. Each semester four distinguished scholars in the fields of humanities, natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, law, and environmental design present lectures to students, faculty, and the general public. Students in the seminar attend the colloquium lectures, complete background readings, and meet for two hours on alternate weeks in the seminar session to discuss issues raised by the colloquium presentations and related readings. Course requirements: attendance at colloquia, attendance and participation in seminars, completion of course readings, brief written critiques of lectures, and a short presentation of literature relevant to colloquium topics.
