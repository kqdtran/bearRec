Proseminar in Classical Archaeology and Ancient Art -- Classics (CLASSIC)C204[2,4units]
Description: This seminar is intended to introduce graduate students--both archaeologists and non-archaeologists--to the discipline of classical archaeology, history, and evolution, and its research tools and bibliography. Since it is both impossible and undesirable to attempt to cover the entire discipline in one semester, after two introductory lectures on the history of the field, we will address a selection of topics that seems representative of its concerns. Also listed as History of Art C204.
