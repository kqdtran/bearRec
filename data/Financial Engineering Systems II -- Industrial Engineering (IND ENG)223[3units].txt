Financial Engineering Systems II -- Industrial Engineering (IND ENG)223[3units]
Description: Advanced graduate course for Ph.D. students interested in pursuing a professional/research career in financial engineering. The course will start with a quick review of 222: the basics of Brownian motion, martingales, Ito's calculus, risk-neutral pricing in continuous time models. It then covers rigorously and in depth the most fundamental probability concepts for financial engineers, including stochastic integral, stochastic differential equations, and semi-martingales. The second half of the course will discuss the most recent topics in financial engineering, such as credit risk and analysis, risk measures and portfolio optimization, and liquidity risk and models.
