America and the Arab-Israeli Conflict: Issues in Policy and Diplomacy -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)162B[4units]
Description: This course focuses on American policy towards the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is neither a comprehensive history of the conflict nor of US policy. Instead, it focuses on key issues that shape and define Americas approach to the conflict, its management, and resolution. The course is very much Washington-centric, taught from the blended perspective of a practitioner but with an analytical and historical bent. It will examine core issues, such as the problem of bias and objectivity, the US-Isreal relationship, the American approach to negotiations, the role of domestic politics in shaping US policy, and the international dynamics involved in the formulation of US policy.
