The Social and Cultural History of Early Modern Europe -- History (HISTORY)165D[4units]
Description: This course examines the lives of ordinary people in Europe from roughly 1300-1800. Its goal, in the words of the great social historian E.P. Thompson, is to rescue them from "the enormous condescension of posterity," exploring how the common people made their own history and used their ingenuity to shape not only their own lives but also, at key moments, the development of European modernity.
