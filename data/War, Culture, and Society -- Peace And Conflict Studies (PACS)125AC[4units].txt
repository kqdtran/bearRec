War, Culture, and Society -- Peace And Conflict Studies (PACS)125AC[4units]
Description: This course examines the experience and meaning of war in the formation of American culture and society. It considers the profound influence war has had in shaping the identities and life chances of succeeding generations of American men and women. It will take special note of the role of race, ethnicity, and class as prisms that filter this process. This course also explores how different interpretations of democracy and nationalism have served as a catalyst for social conflict and change in racial and ethnic identity and relations, especially as reflected in war.
