Issues in Cultural Display: Studio and Post-Studio Art Practices -- Practice Of Art (ART)162[4units]
Description: This is a seminar class designed to engage in "close readings" of contemporary art-making and curatorial practices. Through weekly studio visits with artists and/or curators, the course examines the practical methods, historical origins, philosophical roots, and political and aesthetic implications of each maker's practice. Readings and discussions will focus on (though not be limited to) issues concerning the interaction of aesthetics and ethics; culture and capital; copyright law; art and craft; singular vs. collective authorship.
