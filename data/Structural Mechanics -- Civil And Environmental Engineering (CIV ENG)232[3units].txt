Structural Mechanics -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)232[3units]
Description: The goal of this course is to study the theories of structural mechanics within the framework of nonlinear continuum mechanics of solids. Finite elasticity; invariance. Energy principles: principles of virtual and complementary virtual work; primary and mixed variational principles. Theory of stability: Euler method; stability under follower loads. Classical theories of beams: planar, torsional, and lateral buckling. Plate theories. Invariant theories of structural mechanics: directed continua; Cosserat theories of rods.
