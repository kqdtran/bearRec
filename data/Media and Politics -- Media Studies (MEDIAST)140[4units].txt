Media and Politics -- Media Studies (MEDIAST)140[4units]
Description: This course will examine the influence of consumer marketing trends and techniques on presidential campaigns, and on political culture more broadly. How much truth is there to the idea that selling politicians is like "selling soap"? What is the difference between the psychology of the citizen and the psychology of the consumer? How are the political process and democratic discourse being transformed, for better or worse, by the use of such techniques?
