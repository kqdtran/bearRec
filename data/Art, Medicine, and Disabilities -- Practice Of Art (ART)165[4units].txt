Art, Medicine, and Disabilities -- Practice Of Art (ART)165[4units]
Description: This course will examine how visual artists have responded to illness and disability. We will consider visual representations of disability and healing, as well as the expressive work of visual artists working from within the personal experience of disability; in other words, we will look at disability as both a subject and a source of artistic creation. Several topics, historical and contemporary, will be explored. Students will complete either a semester-long internship with an arts and disability organization, a research paper, or a creative project.
