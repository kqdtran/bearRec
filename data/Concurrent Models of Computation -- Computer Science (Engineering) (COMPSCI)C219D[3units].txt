Concurrent Models of Computation -- Computer Science (Engineering) (COMPSCI)C219D[3units]
Description: Theory and practice of concurrent models of computation (MoCs) with applications to software systems, embedded systems, and cyber-physical systems. Analysis for boundedness, deadlock, and determinacy; formal semantics (fixed point semantics and metric-space models); composition; heterogeneity; and model-based design. MoCs covered may include process networks, threads, message passing, synchronous/reactive, dataflow, rendezvous, time-triggered, discrete events, and continuous time. Also listed as Electrical Engineering C219D.
