Geographic Information Systems for Environmental Science and Management -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)233[3units]
Description: The objectives of the course are to: 1) review the GIS basics (data, analysis, and product generation) with special reference to data used in managing California environments; 2) understand the issues surrounding, and algorithms used in, a particular GIS application; and 3) develop an operational GIS project in a chosen area. This course is divided into three sections: 1) an intensive GIS fundamentals section covering geospatial data input, manipulation, analysis, and effective communication using common geospatial data from California sources; 2) a section that discusses linkages with other GIScience disciplines; 3) a topic based case-study portion; and 4) a project development phase. Topics will need to have management appplicability for an agency, not-for-profit, or similar type of group involved in environmental management. There will be lectures and labs throughout the class, although lab time nearer the end of class will be focused on class projects. Reading will be assigned throughout, and class discussion held. The final class period will be used as an "illustrated paper" session, in which final projects are displayed and discussed.
