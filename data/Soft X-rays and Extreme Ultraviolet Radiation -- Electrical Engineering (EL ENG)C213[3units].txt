Soft X-rays and Extreme Ultraviolet Radiation -- Electrical Engineering (EL ENG)C213[3units]
Description: This course will explore modern developments in the physics and applications of soft x-rays. It begins with a review of electromagnetic radiation at short wavelengths including dipole radiation, scattering and refractive index, using a semi-classical atomic model. Subject matter will include the generation of x-rays with laboratory tubes, synchrotron radiation, laser-plasma sources, x-ray lasers, and black body radiation. Concepts of spatial and temporal coherence will be discussed. Also listed as Applied Science and Technology C210.
