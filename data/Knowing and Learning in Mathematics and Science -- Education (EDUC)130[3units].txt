Knowing and Learning in Mathematics and Science -- Education (EDUC)130[3units]
Description: This course offers a sequence of collaborative problem-solving and reflection activities through which students will be able to appreciate and develop a coherent, effective approach to the teaching and learning of any mathematical or scientific conceptual domain. Issues of cognition, culture, and pedagogy will emerge from participants' struggles to explain their own reasoning. In-class problem solving experiences will provide grist for reflection. Extensive readings are discussed in a bSpace forum. Students are placed in, and do course projects in, local classrooms.
