Contemporary Improvisation Ensemble -- Music (MUSIC)147[2units]
Description: This is an intermediate-advanced repertoire ensemble performing music that incorporates experimental practices in contemporary improvised music, encompassing several styles of music and a variety of approaches. We will work on traditionally notated scores as well as graphic notation and other structures. We will also look at game pieces such as John Zorn's Cobra, pieces by the graduate composers, and music using various conducting techniques for focusing ensembles of improvisers. All instruments welcome, including electronic and non-western.
