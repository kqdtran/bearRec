Survey of Human Physiology -- Integrative Biology (INTEGBI)132[3units]
Description: Mechanisms by which key physiological priorities are maintained in healthy humans. From a basis in elementary theories of information and control, we develop an understanding of homeostasis of cellular composition, structure, and energy metabolism. We then study neural and endocrine signaling in humans, and develop the key concepts of control and homeostasis in all the major organ and multi-organ systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, metabolic, reproductive, and immune systems, growth and development, and sensory and motor systems.
