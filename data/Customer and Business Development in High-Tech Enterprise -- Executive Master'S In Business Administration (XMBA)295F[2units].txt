Customer and Business Development in High-Tech Enterprise -- Executive Master'S In Business Administration (XMBA)295F[2units]
Description: This course is about how to successfully organize sales, marketing, and business development in a startup. For the purpose of this course, a "startup" can either be a new venture, or an existing company entering a new market. Both must solve a common set of issues: Where is our market? Who are our customers? How do we build the right team? How do we scale sales? These issues are at the heart of the "Customer Development" process covered in this course.
