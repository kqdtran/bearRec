Modeling Energy, Environmental, and Resource Systems -- Energy And Resources Group (ENE,RES)220[3units]
Description: A first course in modeling with an emphasis on optimization and on applications in energy, environment, and resource management. Readings, lectures, homework, and small projects will be used to help understand the role of modeling in exploring a variety of questions associated with energy and resources. Course is based in Excel, both the native Solver module and the more powerful add-in OptQuest that is included with the textbook, so each student will be able to apply the learned skills in a wide variety of potential research and work environments. Goals: the student will be able to describe a problem from an optimization perspective, formulate the appropriate mathematical programming model to examine the problem, solve the model, and interpret the results. Course provides the fundamental basis for more sophisticated modeling, but does not cover algorithm implementations.
