Poverty and Population -- Public Health (PB HLTH)181[3units]
Description: Globally one million more births than deaths occur every 112 hours, 90% in the poorest countries. Between 1960 and 1980, considerable attention was focused on rapid population growth. Afterwards, the attention has faded and investment in family planning evaporated. Family size among some of the poorest women is increasing. This course seeks to provide an understanding of the relationships between population growth, poverty, women's autonomy, and health. It explores the political "fashions" underlying changing paradigms among demographers, and economists, and development specialists.
