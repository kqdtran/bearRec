Approaches to Sculpture: Installations -- Practice Of Art (ART)138[4units]
Description: In this class we will consider sculptural issues of (and beyond) the object itself, notions of "site specific," and of whether an object is distinct from its environment or is part of it. We will also question issues of space, placement, installation, context, and public interaction. Students will engage with a variety of sites, both on and off campus, with drawings and written proposals being an intergral part of all projects. Lectures and demonstrations will introduce students to techniques and varied applications.
