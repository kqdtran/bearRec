Four Centuries of Racial Vision and Division in the U.S. -- Sociology (SOCIOL)131F[4units]
Description: This course mixes sociological theory and social history to trace the workings of race as a principle of social vision and division. It proceeds through a focused inquiry into the making, functioning, and contradictions of four "peculiar institutions" that have operated to define, confine, and control African Americans in the history of the United States: slavery; the Jim Crow system of legal discrimination and segregation; the ghetto of the Northern metropolis; and the novel institutional mesh formed by the hyperghetto and the prison.
