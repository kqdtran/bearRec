Papyrology -- Classics (CLASSIC)225[2,4units]
Description: The course introduces students to Greek papyrology. Its principal aim is to develop the skills necessary to edit and interpret papyrological texts. Sessions are devoted to learning the techniques of papyrology and to investigating historical issues to which the papyrological corpus has much to contribute (the ancient economy, gender in antiquity, education, etc.). Extensive use will be made of Berkeley's outstanding collection of papyri from Tebtunis.
