Conceptual Change -- Education (EDUC)229F[3units]
Description: "Conceptual change" concerns broad and deep changes in a person's knowledge about a domain. This opposes it, for example, to the learning of facts and skill acquisition. The course emphasizes recent cognitive science-oriented approaches to: defining "broad and deep" learning; understanding its properties. It draws on diverse other approaches including developmental psychology; analogies to the history of science; "misconceptions;" computational and epistemological approaches.
