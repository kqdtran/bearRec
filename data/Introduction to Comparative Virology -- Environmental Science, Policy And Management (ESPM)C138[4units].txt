Introduction to Comparative Virology -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)C138[4units]
Description: This course will provide a comparative overview of virus life cycles and strategies viruses use to infect and replicate in hosts. We will discuss virus structure and classification and the molecular basis of viral reproduction, evolution, assembly, and virus-host interactions. Common features used during virus replication and host cellular responses to infection will be covered. Topics also included are common and emerging virus diseases, their control, and factors affecting their spread. Also listed as Plant and Microbial Biology C114 and Molecular and Cell Biology C114.
