Resource Management 1 -- Education (EDUC)279A[3units]
Description: This course examines management tools and financial methods of effective leadership of school districts in California. The course will present strategies from both business and educational perspectives and will challenge conventional financial management practices in California school systems. Specific areas of emphasis will be on maximizing the effective use of educational resources (e.g., financial analyses, budget techniques, cost analyses, management information systems), understanding the constraints that influence public school expenditures (e.g., state and federal legislation), and accomplishing the educational objectives of the school system through financial application (cost analysis and project management techniques). The underlying assumption of the course is that informed financial leadership can improve the opportunity to achieve educational achievement and equity in public school organizations.
