Engineering Analysis Using the Finite Element Method -- Mechanical Engineering (MEC ENG)C180[3units]
Description: This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis. Also listed as Civil and Environmental Engineering C133.
