Graduate Student Instructor Training Seminar -- Political Science (POL SCI)375[2units]
Description: This course is intended for all new graduate student instructors (GSI) in the Department of Political Science, and is meant to be taken simultaneously with the first semester of teaching as a GSI. The course functions as a participatory workshop. Although the course is intended for first-time GSIs, it is not a course in "how to be a GSI," but rather, how to be an effective political science teacher, now and at later steps in professional careers. Workshop time will be divided among presentations by the instructor, discussion of required readings, and discussion of weekly assignments in relation to challenges encountered by GSIs in the course of their teaching.
