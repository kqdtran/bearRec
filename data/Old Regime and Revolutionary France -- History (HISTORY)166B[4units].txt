Old Regime and Revolutionary France -- History (HISTORY)166B[4units]
Description: France from the rise of Louis XIV to the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte. The course will explore the socio-economic and political factors that allowed France to emerge as the most powerful nation in Europe under Louis XIV. We will assess the extent of the kingdom's cultural influence and the realities of everyday life under the "old regime." We will then examine the intellectual, social, political, and religious developments of the eighteenth century--such as the Enlightenment, Jansenism, and colonialism--that ultimately led to a total assault against the monarchy in 1789, and finally, the outbreak, course, and consequences of the first great democratic revolution in modern Europe.
