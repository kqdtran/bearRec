Issues in First and Second Language Acquisition -- Education (EDUC)240C[3units]
Description: This course deals with issues related to language learning and development in school-age children. How do they acquire the language skills needed for literacy and academic development? How do children make the transition from home to school language use? How do children learn a second language? What happens when learning a second language results in the loss of the first language? We will consider the educational, social and cognitive implications of these issues.
