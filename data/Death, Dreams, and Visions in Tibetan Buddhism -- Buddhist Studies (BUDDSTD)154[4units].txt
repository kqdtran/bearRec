Death, Dreams, and Visions in Tibetan Buddhism -- Buddhist Studies (BUDDSTD)154[4units]
Description: Tibetan Buddhists view the moment of death as a rare opportunity for transformation. This course examines how Tibetans have used death and dying in the path to enlightment. Readings will address how Tibetan funerary rituals work to assist the dying toward this end, and how. Buddhist practioners prepare for this crucial moment through tantric meditation, imaginative rehearsals, and explorations of the dream state.
