Magnetism and Magnetic Materials -- Materials Science And Engineering (MAT SCI)224[3units]
Description: This course covers the fundamentals of magnetism and magnetic materials in the first two-thirds of the class. Topics include magnetic moments in classical versus quantum mechanical pictures, diamagnetism, paramagnetism, crystal field environments, dipolar and exchange interactions, ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, magnetic domains, magnetic anisotropy, and magnetostriction. Magnetic materials covered include transition metals, their alloys and oxides, rare earths and their oxides, organic and molecular magnets. Throughout the course, experimental techniques in magnetic characterization will be discussed. The second part of the course will focus on particular magnetic materials and devices that are of technological interest (e.g., magnetoresistive and magneto-optical materials and devices). Additional topics include biomagnetism and spin glasses.
