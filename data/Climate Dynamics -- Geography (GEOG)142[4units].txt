Climate Dynamics -- Geography (GEOG)142[4units]
Description: This course examines how various components of the climate system--the atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere--interact in determining its observed state. Covered topics: observations of the climate system; the earth's energy balance; atmospheric radiative transfer; the surface energy balance; the hydrologic cycle; atmospheric circulation and its relation to the energy balance; the role of the ocean and the cryosphere. Additional topics, as time permits, will cover climate change, natural and anthropogenic; and computer modeling of climate.
