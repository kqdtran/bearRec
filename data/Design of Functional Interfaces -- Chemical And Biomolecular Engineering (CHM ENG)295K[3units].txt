Design of Functional Interfaces -- Chemical And Biomolecular Engineering (CHM ENG)295K[3units]
Description: This course introduces students to the concepts and techniques involved in the design and physical characterization of advanced functional materials consisting of well-defined interfaces. Throughout the course, principles of supramolecular chemistry on solid surfaces are applied to functional systems. Materials with different connectivity and structure at the active site are compared for development of understanding. Specific topics include catalysis, separations, encapsulation, and biomedicine.
