Exploration, Ore Petrology, and Geochemistry -- Earth And Planetary Science (EPS)210[4units]
Description: Overview of geological, petrological, and geochemical analysis of ore forming processes including sedimentary, magmatic, hydrothermal, and geothermal resources. Geochemical rock buffers and hydrothermal phase equilibria. Electro-geochemistry of near surface oxidation of primary ores related to climate change, hydrological evolution, and tectonics. Exploration for earth materials for conventional and sustainable technologies including multiple junction semiconductor photo-voltaic cells. Mass balance modeling of ore-forming systems and soils. Environmental management of exploration sites. Lab includes macroscopic and X-ray identification of ore and alteration minerals and ore microscopy. Field trips use digital GIS mapping methods for rock type, structure, mineralization, and wall rock alteration. Integration interpretation of geophysics with geology.
