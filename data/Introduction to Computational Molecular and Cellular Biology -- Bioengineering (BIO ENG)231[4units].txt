Introduction to Computational Molecular and Cellular Biology -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)231[4units]
Description: Topics include computational approaches and techniques to gene structure and genome annotation, sequence alignment using dynamic programming, protein domain analysis, RNA folding and structure prediction, RNA sequence design for synthetic biology, genetic and biochemical pathways and networks, UNIX and scripting languages, basic probability and information theory. Various "case studies" in these areas are reviewed and web-based computational biology tools will be used by students and programming projects will be given.
