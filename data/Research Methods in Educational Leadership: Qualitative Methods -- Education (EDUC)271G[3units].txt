Research Methods in Educational Leadership: Qualitative Methods -- Education (EDUC)271G[3units]
Description: This course introduces future educational leaders to the world of qualitative research so that they will be able to read qualitative studies intelligently, and learn to design and conduct qualitatively oriented studies themselves. Beginning with an overview of the epistemological assumptions behind different kinds of research, the course will explore various types of qualitative research approaches and the kinds of topics and queries they support. Students will read and critique examples of published research of various kinds, partially chosen for the interests and inputs of course participants. Next, students will investigate topic development, the various methods of collecting and analyzing qualitative data, and writing the report. The class is designed so that students simultaneously read about and discuss qualitative research, and conduct research themselves.
