Advanced Developmental and Stem Cell Biology -- Molecular And Cell Biology (MCELLBI)231[4units]
Description: Principles of animal development will be set forth from the classical and recent experimental analysis of induction, localization, patterning mutants, axis formation, regional gene expression, and cell interactions. Early development of selected vertebrates and invertebrates will be examined, and emerging topics in microRNA and stem cell biology will be highlighted. A weekly discussion section with readings from the research literature is required.
