Single Molecular Imaging of Macromolecular Enzymes -- Molecular And Cell Biology (MCELLBI)218Q[2units]
Description: Yildiz laboratory combines molecular biology and single molecule biophysical techniques to understand mechanisms that underlie cellular organization and motility. Specific focuses of the lab are to dissect 1) the mechanism of cytoplasmic dynein motility, 2) the regulation of intraflagellar transport, and 3) the protection and maintenance of mammalian telomeres.
