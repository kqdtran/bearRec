Reflections of Gender, Culture, and Ethnicity in American Dance -- Theater, Dance, And Performance Studies (THEATER)52AC[3units]
Description: Working with the premise that the context, content, and form of any dance event serve as a window on culture, we focus on dance associated with at least three of the following groups: African Americans, Asian Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Chicano/Latinos, and European Americans. We will look at traditional dance events as well as transcultural currents in American dance.
