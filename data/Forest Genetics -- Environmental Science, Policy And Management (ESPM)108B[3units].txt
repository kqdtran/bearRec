Description: Course covers basic mechanisms of inheritance for understanding principles of population genetics and analysis of quantitative traits. It examines methods of measuring and describing quantitative genetic variation in trees. Examples of theoretical aspects of genetics are used to understand patterns of genetic variation in natural populations of forest trees, applications to conservation biology, and their implications for developing strategies for commercial programs of forest tree improvement.
