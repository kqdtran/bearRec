Interest Group Politics: Lobbying and Influences -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)162H[4units]
Description: This course will explore the role of interest groups and lobbyists in the American political process. We will discuss what makes an influential lobbyist in Washington. We will examine the ways in which organized interests try to achieve their goals, and what determines whether or not they are successful. We will investigate whether the tens of thousand of lobbyists roaming the streets of Washington improve or detract from the quality of American democracy.
