The Rise and Fall of the Second Reich: Germany 1770-1918 -- History (HISTORY)167B[4units]
Description: This course provides the essential foundation for understanding the catastrophic history of Germany in the 20th Century, as well as some of its successes. A central theme is the struggle to define and impose a single national identity on socially, culturally, and religiously diverse peoples in an age of Great Power conflict. Although the region now known as Germany will be the focus of our investigation, considerable attention will also be paid to the Hapsburg Empire, for until 1866 Austria was officially a part of "Germany" and remained, for nearly a century thereafter, culturally and in popular consciousness a part of a "Greater Germany."
