The Urban Experience -- Geography (GEOG)70AC[3units]
Description: We will track the historical evolution of the American city. We'll look at the economics of city life, at the organization of metropolitan political power, and at the aesthetics of the urban scene--to see how the core cultural themes of American urban life have endured over time while continuously adjusting to new circumstances. Our approach is to focus on major themes in urban life and to show how various groups have had different kinds of experiences in these urban realms.
