Social Investing--Recent Findings in Management and Finance -- Master'S In Business Administration (MBA)292I[1units]
Description: This course introduces the field of social investment. The use of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) criteria is becoming increasingly prevalent among both high net worth individuals and institutions. Many ethical and religious traditions advocate altruism and community-mindedness in all dealings, while some economic and financial theorists argue for a narrow focus on risk and reward, with little regard for the impact of decisions on stakeholder groups or the environment.
