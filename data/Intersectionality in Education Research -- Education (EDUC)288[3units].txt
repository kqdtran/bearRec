Intersectionality in Education Research -- Education (EDUC)288[3units]
Description: This course is designed to explore the theoretical and methodological questions raised by the concept of intersectionality - the idea that human beings possess multiple identities simultaneously. Most of the work in this area has been theoretical. This course acquaints students with that theoretical literature and helps them apply these theories in their empirical work. The goal is to provide students with the background necessary to incorporate intersectionality into their future research.
