Interdisciplinary Food and Agriculture Studies -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)226[3units]
Description: A graduate seminar exploring the ecological, social, and economic risks inherent in different forms of agriculture, from highly diversified, agroecological farming systems to industrialized agriculture. We will examine how different farm management techniques, government policies, supply chains, R&D, technology, and science may influence various risks and uncertainties, including climate change, agrobiodiversity, farmer livelihoods, food safety, public health, and nutrition.
