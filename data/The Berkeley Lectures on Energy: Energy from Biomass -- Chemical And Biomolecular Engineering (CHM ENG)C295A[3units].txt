The Berkeley Lectures on Energy: Energy from Biomass -- Chemical And Biomolecular Engineering (CHM ENG)C295A[3units]
Description: After an introduction to the different aspects of our global energy consumption, the course will focus on the role of biomass. The course will illustrate how the global scale of energy guides the biomass research. Emphasis will be places on the integration of the biological aspects (crop selection, harvesting, storage, and distribution, and chemical composition of biomass) with the chemical aspects to convert biomass to energy. The course aims to engage students in state-of-art research. Also listed as Bioengineering C281, Plant and Microbial Biology C224, and Chemistry C238.
