BEAR Center Seminar -- Education (EDUC)270B[2,3units]
Description: This seminar constitutes one of the ways in which the Berkeley Evaluation and Assessment Research (BEAR) Center fulfills its role of supporting student research. The topic of the seminar will change from semester to semester, following themes chosen by the instructor and the participants. The seminar is an opportunity for students and faculty to present their recent and ongoing work for in-depth review and commentary. In addition, visitors to the campus with expertise relevant to the topic(s) under examination will be invited to present at the seminar and join in the discussion. Students taking this course for two units will make a presentation of a current research interest to the seminar. Students taking this course for three units will also be required to attend a one-hour discussion following each presentation and will write a critique of one other student's presentation.
