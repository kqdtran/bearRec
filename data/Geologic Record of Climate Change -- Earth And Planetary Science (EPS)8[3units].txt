Geologic Record of Climate Change -- Earth And Planetary Science (EPS)8[3units]
Description: This course will review the geologic record of climate change emphasizing how such knowledge can constrain present day thinking about (and predictive models of) future climate change. We will cover the entire spectrum of climate variations, from the formation of the Earth's early atmosophere 4.6 billion years ago to the ice ages to the development of instrumental records.
