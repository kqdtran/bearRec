Global Health Policy -- Public Health (PB HLTH)220E[2,3units]
Description: This course will provide an intensive introduction to current topics in international health policy. Students in the course will become familiar with the major actors, institutions, and regimes that shape international health policy. The course will also introduce students to theories of governance as they apply to international settings and evaluate the relative roles of state actors, NGOs, and international regimes in producing key health policy outcomes. The course will cover several current issues in international health and will require students to critically assess the state of policy with respect to these issues. Using Bardach's method for policy analysis, students will analyze current policies and propose policy alternatives with an assessment of the tradeoffs implied in choosing a given policy option over its competitors.
