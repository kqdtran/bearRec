Teaching Linguistic and Cultural Minority Students -- Education (EDUC)246A[1-3units]
Description: The objective of this course is to prepare teachers to work with linguistic minority students. We will consider ways in which different groups socialize children for learning and ways in which learning patterns acquired in the home can conflict with the culture of school. Student teachers will consider instructional approaches for working with linguistically and culturally diverse students in their classrooms.
