Ecological Engineering for Water Quality Improvement -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)113N[3units]
Description: Ecological engineering approaches for treating contaminated water using natural processes to improve water quality. Emphasis on combining basic science and engineering approaches to understand the fundamental processes that govern the effectiveness of complex natural treatment systems. Applications include constructed wetlands, waste stabilization ponds, stormwater bioretention, decentralized wastewater management, ecological sanitation. Laboratory sessions will consist of design and monitoring of laboratory and full-scale natural treatment systems, including a range of water quality measurements.
