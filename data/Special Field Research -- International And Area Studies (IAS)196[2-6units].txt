Special Field Research -- International And Area Studies (IAS)196[2-6units]
Description: Students to work in internship programs selected and approved in advance by the faculty advisory committee and for which volunteer agreements have been established between the sponsoring organization and the student. Students will be expected to produce two brief progress reports for their faculty advisor during the course of the interniship, as well as produce a final capstone piece for the course consisting of no fewer than 25 pages. The capstone paper will be graded A-F and judged on the same scholastic merits as a seminar or honors course. If taken on a P/NP basis, the established C+ standard will apply. The course is only available to students in the Global Poverty and Practice minor. Other International Area Studies majors may enroll if approved by their respective faculty chair.
