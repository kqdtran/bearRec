Signal Transduction Mechanisms -- Molecular And Cell Biology (MCELLBI)219T[2units]
Description: Discussion of recent research on various aspects of signal transduction mechanisms in eukaryotic cells, including G protein-coupled receptors, protein kinase cascades, synthesis and mobilization of lipid mediators, calcium sensing and response pathways, activation and inhibition of gene expression, and the biochemical basis of signal desensitization and physiological adaptation, with strong emphasis on genetic and molecular analysis of these systems, especially in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
