Global Change Biology -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)152[3units]
Description: The course will focus on understanding how anthropogenic changes to the global environment (e.g., climate change, habitat destruction, global trade) impact organisms. We will evaluate responses to global change in a wide diversity of organisms (from microbes to mammals) and ecosystems (from arctic to temperate to tropical). We will also explore conservation and mitigation strategies in the face of global change. Discussions will draw on recent primary research and case studies.
