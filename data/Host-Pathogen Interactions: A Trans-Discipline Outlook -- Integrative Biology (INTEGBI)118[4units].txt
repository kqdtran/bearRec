Host-Pathogen Interactions: A Trans-Discipline Outlook -- Integrative Biology (INTEGBI)118[4units]
Description: The second half of the 20th century is marked by great strides in the battle against infectious diseases. However, the forces that drive pathogen evolution continue to pose new challenges for science and medicine. In this course we will cover various aspects relating to host-pathogen interactions, focusing on animals and their bacterial pathogens. We will address the ecology of host-pathogen interactions, their shaping by co-evolution, examine prominent molecular mechanisms taking part in this warfare and learn how ancient mechanisms are used and reused through millions of years of evolution. The course will examine how better understanding of host-pathogen interactions can suggest new strategies for fighting infectious diseases.
