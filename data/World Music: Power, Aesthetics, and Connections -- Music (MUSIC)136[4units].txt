World Music: Power, Aesthetics, and Connections -- Music (MUSIC)136[4units]
Description: This course focuses on selected "world musics" to examine how, through their soundings, they make audible their entanglements with particular locales, times, and spaces. In focusing on their soundings, we will examine not only the music technologies they use, but also the diasporic connections they establish. Issues of power relations will be central to our exploration of how these musics circulate and what values (social, economic, and aesthetic) they have acquired on specific markets. In so doing, we will situate these musics in relation to colonial legacies, the politics of labeling, globalization, and music industries.
