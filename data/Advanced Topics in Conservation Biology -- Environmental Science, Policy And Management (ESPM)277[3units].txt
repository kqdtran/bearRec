Advanced Topics in Conservation Biology -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)277[3units]
Description: A graduate level seminar covering advanced topics in conservation of biodiversity, focused on designing protected area networks. We will first lay the groundwork for the course by exploring the fundamental papers in ecology and conservation biology that led to systematic conservation planning. Then, we will study various issues at the current frontiers of the discipline, such as incorporating threats, costs, evolutionary processes, and ecosystem services into reserve network design. The class will encourage student engagement through discussions, peer instruction and peer review of essays.
