Environmental Physical-Chemical Processes -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)211A[3units]
Description: Fundamental concepts of physical-chemical processes that affect water quality in natural and engineered environmental systems. Focus is on developing a qualitative understanding of mechanisms as well as quantitative tools to describe, predict, and control the behavior of physical-chemical processes. Topics include reactor hydraulics and reaction kinetics, gas transfer, adsorption, particle characteristics, flocculation, gravitational separations, filtration, membranes, and disinfection.
