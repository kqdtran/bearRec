The Secret Life of Buildings -- Architecture (ARCH)244[3units]
Description: This exploratory seminar addresses a secret life of buildings related to physical performance. Students examine architectural, lighting, and mechanical systems in existing buildings with attention to energy use, occupant well-being, and architectural spacemaking. The seminar applies a collection of measurement techniques, often involving novel approaches, to reveal operating patterns in the complex environment of contemporary buildings. The personal experience students gain in performing the evaluations contributes to the students' experiential base at a formative time. Analysis of data collected in the field and the comparison of these data to values given by simulation tools provides a foundation for understanding the more abstract tools and standards used by designers in practice. The juxtaposition of design intention and post-occupancy performance can be a powerful learning experience now, as well as preparation for evaluating building performance in the future.
