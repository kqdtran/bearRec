A History of Race and Ethnicity in Western North America, 1598-Present -- Ethnic Studies (ETH STD)10AC[4units]
Description: This course explores the role of "race" and ethnicity in the history of what became the Western United States from the Spanish invasion of the Southwest to contemporary controversies surrounding "race" in California. Rather than providing a continuous historical narrative, or treating each racialized "other" separately, the course works through a series of chronologically organized events in which issues of racial differences played key roles in creating what became a western identity.
