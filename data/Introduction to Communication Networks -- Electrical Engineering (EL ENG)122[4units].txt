Introduction to Communication Networks -- Electrical Engineering (EL ENG)122[4units]
Description: This course is an introduction to the design and implementation of computer networks. We will focus on the concepts and fundamental design principles that have contributed to the Internet's scalability and robustness and survey the underlying technologies--e.g., Ethernet, 802.11, DSL, optical links--that have led to the Internet's phenomenal success. Topics include layering, congestion/flow/error control, routing, addressing, multicast, packet scheduling, switching, internetworking, network security, and networking/programming interfaces.
