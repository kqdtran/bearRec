International Non-governmental Organizations -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)161[4units]
Description: As the international community seeks to define the "post Cold War era," and more recently, the "post 9-11 era," increasing attention focuses on the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs). NGOs appear to be playing an increasingly critical role in affecting international political and economic outcomes. NGOs act as knowledge providers for national governments and international organizations. They act as watchdogs and lobbyists for policy change. They act as critical intermediaries that can provide cross-national linkages between governmental players, or between governments and local populations. This course examines both conceptual and practical issues surrounding NGOs and international relations.
