Fundamentals of Molecular and Cell Biology -- Molecular And Cell Biology (MCELLBI)200B[3units]
Description: The goal of this course is to provide graduate-level instruction on molecular and cellular biosciences from a highly-integrated systems perspective, rather than using a more classic, techniques-oriented format. A collection of approaches, and a focus on critical thinking and problem solving, will be used to show how fundamental, highly-significant biological problems are "cracked open." Reading will be assigned from a mix of classic and current peer-reviewed papers selected by the instructors.
