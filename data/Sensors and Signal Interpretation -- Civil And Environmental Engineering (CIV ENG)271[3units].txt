Sensors and Signal Interpretation -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)271[3units]
Description: An introduction to the fundamentals of sensor usage and signal processing, and their application to civil systems. In particular, the course focuses on how basic classes of sensors work, and how to go about choosing the best of the new MEMS-based devices for an application. The interpretation of the data focuses on analysis of transient signals, an area typically ignored in traditional signal processing courses. Goals include development of a critical understanding of the assumptions used in common sensing and analysis methods and their implications, strengths, and limitations.
