Immigration and Incorporation -- Sociology (SOCIOL)280X[3units]
Description: This seminar examines the dynamics of migration, integration, and citizenship, both from the perspective of the receiving society and from the lived experiences of migrants themselves. The seminar focuses on processes of incorporation--economic, social, cultural, and political--but we also look at paradigms that challenge an integrationist reading of migration, in particular transnationalism and models of postnational citizenship.
