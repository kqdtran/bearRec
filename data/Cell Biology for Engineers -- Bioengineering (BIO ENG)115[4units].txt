Cell Biology for Engineers -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)115[4units]
Description: The structural and functional characteristics of tissues are altered by cells in response to culture conditions, loading, injury, and various other factors. A contemporary understanding of the form, function, and longevity of tissues includes knowledge of tissue microstructure, composition of matrix, and cell function. Students will be introduced to molecular biology techniques as applied to cells and tissues including immunofluorescence, image analysis, protein quantification, gene expression, and cell culture.
