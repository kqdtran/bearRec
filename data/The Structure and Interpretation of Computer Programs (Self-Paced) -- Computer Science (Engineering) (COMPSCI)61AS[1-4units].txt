The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Self-Paced) -- Computer Science (Engineering) (COMPSCI)61AS[1-4units]
Description: Introductory programming and computer science. Abstraction as means to control program complexity. Programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, client/server, and declarative (logic). Control abstraction: recursion and higher order functions. Introduction to asymptotic analysis of algorithms. Data abstraction: abstract data types, type-tagged data, first class data types, sequences implemented as lists and as arrays, generic operators implemented with data-directed programming and with message passing. Implementation of object-oriented programming with closures over dispatch procedures. Introduction to interpreters and compilers. There are several significant programming projects. Course may be completed in one or two semesters. Students must complete a mimimum of two units during their first semester of 61AS.
