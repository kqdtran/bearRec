Language of Advertising -- Linguistics (LINGUIS)40[3units]
Description: The ways in which language is used in advertising. An introduction to basic linguistic principles of how speech acts work, the semantic effects of framing, and the contribution of language to multimodal print and video advertising: the division of labor between images and words, and different strategies in integrating them into a single message. Cultural differences both in advertising "message strategies" (what content is presented) and in "formal strategies" (how is it presented?).
