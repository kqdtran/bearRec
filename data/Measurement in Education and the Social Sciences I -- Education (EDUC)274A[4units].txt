Measurement in Education and the Social Sciences I -- Education (EDUC)274A[4units]
Description: Students will learn good measurement practice by constructing an instrument and investigating its measurement properties (specifically, validity, and reliability). The act of measuring will be positioned as a link between qualitative observations and quantitative measures, and this will be discussed in a variety of contexts, such as interviewing, standardized testing, and performance assessment. We will discuss both classical and modern testing approaches from conceptual and practical points of view.
