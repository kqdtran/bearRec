Description: The course will be organized by principal activities: group readings, book reports, expert and novice methodology presentations, in-class research and analysis, and student research. For each activity, we will look at the full breadth of methodology, from "how-to" methods and specific areas of concern to general questions including: what constitutes objective data, what are strengths and weaknesses of methods in regard to various issues, and what are the relations between theory and data?
