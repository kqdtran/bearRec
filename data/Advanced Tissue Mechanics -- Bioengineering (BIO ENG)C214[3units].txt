Advanced Tissue Mechanics -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)C214[3units]
Description: The goal of this course is to provide a foundation for characterizing and understanding the mechanical behavior of load-bearing tissues. A variety of mechanics topics will be introduced, including anisotropic elasticity and failure, cellular solid theory, biphasic theory, and quasi-linear viscoelasticity (QLV) theory. Building from this theoretical basis, we will explore the constitutive behavior of a wide variety of biological tissues. After taking this course, students should have sufficient background to independently study the mechanical behavior of most biological tissues. Formal discussion section will include a seminar series with external speakers. Also listed as Mechanical Engineering C214.
