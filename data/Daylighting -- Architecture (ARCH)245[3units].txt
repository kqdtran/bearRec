Daylighting -- Architecture (ARCH)245[3units]
Description: This exercise-based seminar explores qualities of daylight with attention to developing an understanding of the physical and perceptual mechanisms that shape our experience of daylight. Students use three-dimensional models as a tool for the investigation of daylight in buildings. The distribution of natural light in architectural space is a particularly complex phenomenon that defies realistic numerical analysis. In contrast to the complexity of a computer simulation, physical models offer a practical tool for understanding natural light in architectural space. Well suited to the skills of an architect, this technique can be used at all stages of the architectural design process. Models can predict a design's performance in quantitative detail and provide immediate visual information for assessment of qualitative issues. Student work will include the construction and analysis of lighting models as well as a series of exercises designed to hone students' capacities to observe and understand light.
