Advanced GeoEngineering Testing and Design -- Civil And Environmental Engineering (CIV ENG)273[3units]
Description: Field and laboratory testing of soils to support analysis and design of earth structures. In situ field testing, including SPT, CPT, and vane shear, undisturbed sampling of soil, and laboratory testing of soil, including advanced equipment, instrumentation, data acquisition, and measurement techniques. Consolidation and static and cyclic triaxial and simple shear testing under stress- and strain-control with pore pressure measurements. Preparation of an engineering report.
