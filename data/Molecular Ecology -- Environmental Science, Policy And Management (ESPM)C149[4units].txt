Molecular Ecology -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)C149[4units]
Description: This course focuses on the use of molecular genetic information in ecology. Applications and techniques covered range from analysis of parentage and relatedness (DNA fingerprinting and multilocus genetic analysis) through gene flow, biogeographic history and community composition (comparative DNA sequencing) to analysis of diet and trophic interactions (biological isotopes). Grades are based on one final exam, problem sheets, and a critique of a recent research paper. Also listed as Integrative Biology C149.
