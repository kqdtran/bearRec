Introduction to Earth System Science -- Geography (GEOG)40[4units]
Description: The goals of this introductory Earth System Science course are to achieve a scientific understanding of important problems in global environmental change and to learn how to analyze a complex system using scientific methods. Earth System Science is an interdisciplinary field that describes the cycling of energy and matter between the different spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere) of the earth system. In addition to the themes of climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and biodiversity loss, we will also discuss air and water pollution, fisheries depletion, and science in public policy.
