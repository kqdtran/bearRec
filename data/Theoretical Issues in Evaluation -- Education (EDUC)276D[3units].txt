Theoretical Issues in Evaluation -- Education (EDUC)276D[3units]
Description: In this seminar, we will engage in a critical examination of various scholars' theoretical perspectives on some of the fundamental issues in evaluation practice, understand why we should care about these issues and what theorists have to say, how theorists' perspectives reflect their disciplinary training, methodological preferences, and/or their personal evaluation experiences, and the extent to which their theoretical perspectives are or are not connected with evaluation practice.
