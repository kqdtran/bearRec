Special Topics in Biostatistics: Adaptive Designs -- Public Health (PB HLTH)243D[3units]
Description: This course examines the theory and statistical methods for analyzing data generated by adaptive group sequential designs. It also considers the construction of targeted adaptive group sequential designs that adapt in a way that is optimal for the estimation of a particular target feature of the data generating experiment (i.e., causal effect of the treatment). Topics to be covered include: sequential testing, adaptive sample size, martingale estimating functions to construct estimators, targeted maximum likelihood estimation for adaptive designs, targeted Bayesian learning for adaptive designs, martingale theory for the analysis of estimators for adaptive designs.
