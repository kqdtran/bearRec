Micromechanics -- Materials Science And Engineering (MAT SCI)C214[3units]
Description: Basic theories, analytical techniques, and mathematical foundations of micromechanics. It includes 1. physical micromechanics, such as mathematical theory of dislocation, and cohesive fracture models; 2. micro-elasticity that includes Eshelby's eigenstrain theory, comparison variational principles, and micro-crack/micro-cavity based damage theory; 3. theoretical composite material that includes the main methodologies in evaluating overall material properties; 4. meso-plasticity that includes meso-damage theory, and the crystal plasticity; 5. homogenization theory for materials with periodic structures. Also listed as Civil and Environmental Engineering C236.
