Seminar in Portuguese Studies -- International And Area Studies (IAS)202[1units]
Description: Portuguese immigrants have exerted a strong imprint on the landscape and culture of California and other regions of North America, and the study of this diaspora continues to be a lively topic of scholarly research. Likewise, the rapid transformations of Portugal and Portuguese society as it has emerged from the stultifying effects of decades of dictatorship and integrates into the EU make for compelling research topics. The strong parallels between the Mediterranean-climate landscapes of Portugal and California provide excellent opportunities for comparative studies in environment and human adaptations in environment. This seminar provides a forum for the presentation and discussion of ongoing research on topics in Portuguese studies by Berkeley faculty and graduate students, as well as visiting scholars and fellows.
