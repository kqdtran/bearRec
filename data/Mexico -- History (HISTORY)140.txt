Mexico -- History (HISTORY)140
Description: This course surveys Mexican history from the end of the colonial period to the present, with an eye to how the study of Mexican history can help us understand the Mexico of today. Topics include the historical origins of peasant rebellions and their influence on national politics; the tension between democratic pressures and elitist and exclusionary pressures on the political system; neo-liberal economic policies; the powerful influence of the Catholic church; immigration to the U.S.; and the explosive 20th-century growth of Mexico City.
