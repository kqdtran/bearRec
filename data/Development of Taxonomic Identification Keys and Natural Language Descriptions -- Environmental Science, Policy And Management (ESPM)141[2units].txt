Development of Taxonomic Identification Keys and Natural Language Descriptions -- Environmental Science, Policy And Management (ESPM)141[2units]
Description: Tools for identification of organisms to species or higher-level taxonomic groups are critically needed. This course will allow students to learn both the theoretical basis of and practical skills for building traditional dichotomous keys and various types of interactive keys. Emphasis will be on learning to build a web-based interactive key and developing natural language descriptions through students' individual projects. Students can train on the Microptics Digital XLT imaging system and learn to use Lucid and Lucid Phoenix software. Other Internet identification tools will also be surveyed and discussed. Each student will produce an online key as a project.
