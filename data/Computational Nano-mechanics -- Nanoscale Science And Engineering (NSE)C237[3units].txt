Computational Nano-mechanics -- Nanoscale Science And Engineering (NSE)C237[3units]
Description: Basic mathematics foundations, physical models, computational formulations and algorithms that are used in nanoscale simulations and modelings. They include (1) cohesive finite element methods and discontinuous Galerkin methods; (2) meshfree methods, partition of unity methods, and the eXtended finite element methods (X-FEM); (3) quasicontinuum method; (4) molecular dynamics; (5) multiscale simulations; (6) Boltzmann method. Also listed as Civil and Environmental Engineering C237.
