Towards Ambitious Instruction in Mathematics: Research Into Practice -- Education (EDUC)221A[3units]
Description: In this course, students learn to turn mathematics education research into practice through the vehicle of lesson design. Students work in collaborative teams consisting of one beginning mathematics teacher in a teaching credential program and one or more doctoral student researchers. Together each team is responsible for designing, justifying, implementing, researching, and re-designing a lesson that seeks to embody one key aspect of the teacher's vision of effective mathematics instruction.
