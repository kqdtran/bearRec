French for Future Teachers of the Language -- French (FRENCH)138[4units]
Description: Introduction to applied linguistics, for students planning to use their French in language teaching or related careers. In this course we will begin with a general account of the French language--its phonology, morphology, and syntax--and we will subsequently consider specific issues in the learning and teaching of French. We will also examine a variety of commonly used foreign language teaching methods. Students should have a working knowledge of both oral and written French.
