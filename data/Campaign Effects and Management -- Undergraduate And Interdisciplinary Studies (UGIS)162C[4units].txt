Campaign Effects and Management -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)162C[4units]
Description: What does political science research tell us about how to manage a political campaign? We'll begin by discussing the magnitude of effects campaigns have in the face of prevailing forces such as partisanship and macroeconomic health. Next, we'll review experiments that test get-out-the-vote techniques and examine the use of technology in motivating voters. Finally, we'll analyze partisan biases and think about how voters can be persuaded. Parts of this course are quantitative in nature, and students should feel comfortable reading about and working with political data.
