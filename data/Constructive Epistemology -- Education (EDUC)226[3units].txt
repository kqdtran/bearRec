Constructive Epistemology -- Education (EDUC)226[3units]
Description: Many approaches to education take the knowledge to be taught as fixed, and the manipulable objects to be things like methods. By focusing on knowledge per se: what is it; how is it organized and encoded in humans, we are led to questions about what should be taught, based on principles of learnability, etc., rather than just "effective methods." This tactic is valuable in view of the radical changes information technology may have on what we need to teach and what general areas are teachable.
