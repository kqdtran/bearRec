The Comparative Politics of the Welfare State -- Political Science (POL SCI)247G[4units]
Description: This course analyzes the politics of social protection in Western Europe and the United States. After describing different national welfare regimes, we turn to contemporary challenges, notably globalization, persistent poverty, and changes in family forms and gender roles. We also look at the politics of welfare retrenchment and adjustment, paying particular attention to the prospects for progressive social policy. Must reform inevitably scale back protections for the weak and vulnerable, or can equity be safeguarded while promoting efficiency?
