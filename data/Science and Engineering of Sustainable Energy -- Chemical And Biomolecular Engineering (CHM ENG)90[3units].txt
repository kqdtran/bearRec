Science and Engineering of Sustainable Energy -- Chemical And Biomolecular Engineering (CHM ENG)90[3units]
Description: An introduction is given to the science and technologies of producing electricity and transportation fuels from renewable energy resources (biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and wave). Students will be introduced to quantitative calculations and comparisions of energy technologies together with the economic and political factors affecting the transition from nonrenewable to sustainable energy resources. Mass and energy balances are used to analyze the conversion of energy resources.
