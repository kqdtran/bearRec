General Microbiology -- Molecular And Cell Biology (MCELLBI)C112[4units]
Description: This course will explore the molecular bases for physiological and biochemical diversity among members of the two major domains, Bacteria and Archaea. The ecological significance and evolutionary origins of this diversity will be discussed. Molecular, genetic, and structure-function analyses of microbial cell cycles, adaptive responses, metabolic capability, and macromolecular syntheses will be emphasized. Also listed as Plant and Microbial Biology C112.
