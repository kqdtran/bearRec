Milestone 2: Mapping the Professional Knowledge Base -- Education (EDUC)278C[3units]
Description: This second milestone course picks up on the work from the fall. In the fall, students began to identify a field of interest in which they most likely will conduct their research and write their dissertation. Also beginning in the fall, students familiarized themselves with templates for types of dissertations suggested for LEEP students. The second course in the milestone sequence assumes that students have made a selection of a field of interest and are ready to explore its knowledge base. The purpose of the course is to make this exploration fruitful and research-based, and for students to take first steps in applying their new knowledge to a dissertation project of a specific type. At the end of the course, students should be ready to pass the first milestone towards the dissertation: a paper mapping the professional knowledge base in their field of interest. At a later date, this paper will be submitted as one of three qualifying papers to the oral exam committee.
