Grant Writing and Research Presentations -- Plant And Microbial Biology (PLANTBI)297[2units]
Description: Each student will write a grant proposal in three steps: a one page outline, a three-page pre-proposal, and a complete 10-page grant proposal. There will be feedback at each step in the process -- each participant will review the other grant proposals. Some of the scheduled classes will include discussion of the outlines and pre-proposals, and the last class will be organized as a grant panel, with students assigned as primary and secondary reviewers.
