Introduction to the Craft of Creative Writing -- College Writing Programs (COLWRIT)130[4units]
Description: This course in creative writing focuses on three genres: the personal essay, the short story, and the one-act play. The course emphasizes an introduction to craft--how these types of writing are generated, what their elements are, and how the finished pieces work--which students will explore through careful study of models by published writers and through writing and revising their own short pieces.
