Introduction to the Study of Buddhism -- South And Southeast Asian Studies (S,SEASN)C52[4units]
Description: This introduction to the study of Buddhism will consider materials drawn from various Buddhist traditions of Asia, from ancient times down to the present day. However, the course is not intended to be a comprehensive or systematic survey; rather than aiming at breadth, the course is designed around key themes such as ritual, image veneration, mysticism, meditation, and death. The overarching emphasis throughout the course will be on the hermeneutic difficulties attendant upon the study of religion in general, and Buddhism in particular. Also listed as Group in Buddhist Studies C50 and East Asian Languages and Cultures C50.
