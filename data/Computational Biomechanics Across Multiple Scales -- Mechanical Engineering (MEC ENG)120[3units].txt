Computational Biomechanics Across Multiple Scales -- Mechanical Engineering (MEC ENG)120[3units]
Description: This course applies the methods of computational modeling and continuum mechanics to biomedical phenomena spanning various length scales ranging from molecular to cellular to tissue and organ levels. The course is intended for upper level undergraduate students who have been exposed to undergraduate continuum mechanics (statics and strength of materials.)
