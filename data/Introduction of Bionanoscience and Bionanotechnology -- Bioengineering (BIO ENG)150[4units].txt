Introduction of Bionanoscience and Bionanotechnology -- Bioengineering (BIO ENG)150[4units]
Description: This course is intended for the bioengineering or engineering undergraduate students interested in acquiring a background in recent development of bio-nanomaterials and bio-nanotechnology. The emphasis of the class is to understand the properties of biological basis building blocks, their assembly principles in nature, and their application to build functional materials and devices. The goal is for the bioengineering students to gain sufficient chemical and physical aspects of biological materials through the case study of spider webs, silks, sea shells, diatoms, bones, and teeth, as well as recently developed self-assembled nanostructures inspired by nature. The course covers the structures and properties of amino acids, DNAs, sugars, lipids, and their natural and artifical assembly structures. It also covers nanoscale inorganic materials used to develop nano medicines, bio-imaging, bio-sensors, bioelectronics, and machinery.
