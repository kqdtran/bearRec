Japanese Historical Documents -- Japanese (JAPAN)146[4units]
Description: Writings in the Japanese vernacular constitute only a limited part of the total pre-modern Japanese written corpus. Until the 20th century, the preferred medium for most historical texts and male diaries was Sino-Japanese (kanbun). Familiarity with the grammar of this extraordinarily rich tradition is therefore essential for all students of pre-modern Japanese disciplines.
