Introduction to Social Theory and Cultural Analysis -- Interdisciplinary Studies (ISF)100A[4units]
Description: This course draws on the classical traditions of social theory as well as contemporary analysis to examine the basic conceptual underpinnings of modern societies. That is, we explore what it means to live in the modern, postmodern, hyper-modern, or global worlds. In particular we examine the nature of industrial and post-industrial social formations, cultural perceptions, and the development of ideological constructs. Changing understandings of the shapes of power and domination is a central linkage tying these various analyses together. We are particularly interested in charting the interrelationship between quickly shifting social changes on a local and global level and competing theoretical interpretations of their meaning.
