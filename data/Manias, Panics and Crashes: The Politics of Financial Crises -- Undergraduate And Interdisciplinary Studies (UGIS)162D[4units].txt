Manias, Panics and Crashes: The Politics of Financial Crises -- Undergraduate And Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)162D[4units]
Description: This class is designed to help students explore the political dimensions of finanical crises. To do so we will study the behavior of the financial elites, and the dynamic system of rules, norms, markets, and organizations that constitute the political environment of international finance. We will examine the current global financial crisis in comparative and historical perspective. Our inquiry will include an intellectual dialogue with the work of theorists, market participants, and policymakers. How can we prevent another financial catastrophe? What should we do about banks that are "too big to fail"? Will I be able to find a job when I graduate? What can the IMF do to help developing countries cope? How will U.S.-China diplomatic relations be impacted? Is U.S. financial hegemony slowly relegating itself to the dustbin of history? Is the current policy response adequate or are we merely creating another bubble? The Global Financial Crisis is on everyone's minds.
