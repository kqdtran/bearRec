Cross-Cultural Verbal Art -- Linguistics (LINGUIS)127[3units]
Description: This course examines parallels and differences between language art in different cultures, both at the level of form (linguistic parallelism, rhyme, alliteration) and meaning (how is metaphor used, what rhetorical patterns are artistic?). This course is intended to help students develop a sense of what artistic language is, crossculturally, and to let them examine a chosen poetic tradition in detail for their project. The course readings and the theoretical models will be drawn equally from Anthropology and Linguistics.
