Future Ecologies: Urban Design, Climate Adaptation, and Thermodynamics -- Environmental Design (ENV DES)4C[3units]
Description: This course is intended to provide students with an overview of current thinking about cities and their components (buildings, parks, streets) as ecological and cultural systems. It will provide an introduction to methods for investigating the dynamics of flows and relationships in the built environment and students will gain experience constructing their own narratives as ways of asking and answering questions about human habitat that could shape the future.
