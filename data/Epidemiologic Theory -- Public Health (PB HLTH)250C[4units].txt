Epidemiologic Theory -- Public Health (PB HLTH)250C[4units]
Description: This course is a continuation of 250B. The course covers many of the same topics as 250B but explores them in greater breadth and depth. Topics that follow from 250B include causal inference; the interrelation between measures of disease frequency; the theory that underlies case-control studies and the practical issues that relate to implementation of case-control studies; and further exploration of the quantitative aspects of bias, confounding, propensity scores, and measurement error. An introduction to the theory of ecological studies and mixed model analysis also are provided. Readings are primarily from the epidemiologic methods literature, and problems are based on the evaluation of published data. The course is divided into a series of modules that range in length from 1-4 weeks: causal inference/models of causality; epidemiologic measures of disease occurrence and their inter-relations; standardization of rates; bias and validity--general consideration; misclassification/measurement error; confounding; matching; case-control studies; ecological studies.
