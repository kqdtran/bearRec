Research Practicum in Administration -- Education (EDUC)460C[1-3units]
Description: During the fall semester, students complete 294A in which the preliminary Leadership Action Research Project is designed - a summative assessment for the Principal Leadership Institute and the MA program at Berkeley. Through the LARP process, students engage in a cycle of inquiry about a problem or concern that matters to their overall leadership agenda and creates more equitable spaces in urban schools. In this course, students solidify the design of their LARP, take leadership action to implement their action plan, reflect on the action plan, revise the action plan - and make changes as appropriate - thus, engaging actively in the cycle of inquiry.
