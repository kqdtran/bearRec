Against the Grain: Ethnic American Art and Artists -- Ethnic Studies (ETH STD)176[4units]
Description: Comparative survey of art and other cultural production from a cross-section of selected American ethnic groups (in general, Asian American, Chicano, African American, and Native American). We approach works from various critical/theoretical perspectives, often constructing them as we analyze, and through the lens of Ethnic Studies.
