Global Health Core Course -- Public Health (PB HLTH)212D[3units]
Description: This is a graduate level survey course on selected topics in international health designed to introduce students to key areas of the specialty. The course will review the main contributors to the global burden of disease and discuss current interventions and possible approaches for the future. The primary goal of the course is to transfer knowledge and experiences that will prepare public health students to evaluate international health projects and better prepare themselves for international health work. The focus is on developing countries with the most challenging large-scale health problems, where physical and systems infrastructure as well as human resources are poorly developed. The course provides students with the tools to make their own assessments. Complex ethical and political issues pervading this field will also be addressed throughout the course.
