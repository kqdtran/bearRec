S'This course presents psychological and experimental economics research demonstrating departures from perfect rationality, self-interest, and other classical assumptions of economics and explores ways that these departures can be mathematically modeled and incorporated into mainstream positive and normative economics. The course will focus on the behavioral evidence itself, especially on specific formal assumptions that capture the findings in a way that can be used by economists. Economic applications will be used for illustrative purposes, but the course will emphasize formal theory.'

S'Mimesis, Greek for "imitation" is a key term in recent debates in a number of disciplines. However, what is at its core is often astonishingly undefined, open and ambivalent. Starting with antique and medieval works addressing key moments of mimesis we will also explore modern theories of mimesis. Crossing the threshold between pre-modern and modern examples will help us to understand the premises for the visual culture involving the rise of naturalism, and more generally the nature of representation in medieval and early modern culture.'

As digital technologies continue to expand our notion of time and space, value and meaning, artists are using these tools to envision the impossible. Nonlinear and nondestructive editing methods used in digital video are defining new "architectures of time" for cinematic creation and experience, and offer new and innovative possibilities for authoring new forms of the moving image. Through direct experimentation, this course will expose students to a broad range of industry-standard equipment, film and video history, theory, terminology, field, and post-production skills. Students will be required to technically master the digital media tools introduced in the course, and personalize the new possibilities digital video brings to time-based art forms.

Understanding Chinese cities is the key to analyzing the dramatic transformation of Chinese society and culture. This course is designed to teach students to think about Chinese cities in more textured ways. How are urban forms and urban spaces produced through processes of social, political, and ideological conflict? How are cities represented in literary, cinematic, and various popular cultures? How has our imagination of the city been shaped and how are these spatial discourses influencing the making of the cities of tomorrow?'

S'Ideals of good governance are a core concern of many brands of traditional Chinese thought. The image of the ruler whose authority is exercised in harmony with the desires and interests of the society at large plays a key role not only in theories of governance but also in thought about ethics and psychology. There is also a fascination with the bad ruler. In addition to serving as negative examples just as good rulers serve as positive examples, bad rulers also provide an imaginative space for thinking about extremes of human will, offering an outlet for fantasy and vicarious gratification of desires that normally remain taboo.'

S'A Specialty Clinic is offered to graduate students in the Clinical Science program. Each course combines didactics and hands-on clinical work. Students in the course work with the instructor to develop the topic of interest by reviewing the empirical literature, defining and developing an intervention/consultation, defining a clinical population, marketing and delivering the intervention/consultation, and evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention/consultation. A number of readings are included in the course, and class discussion is a central part of the course. Written products are also a part of the course, either in the form of a presentation or publication of findings from the clinic. A Specialty Clinic also includes its own Case Conference and supervisors to handle supervision of the clinical cases.'

Recent research has begun to shed light on the psychological legacy of prejudice and stereotyping for their targets. This course will review the major contributions of each of these literatures, providing students with a broad understanding of both classic and current issues in the field. The course will be divided into three sections: bias (i.e., the perpetrator's perspective), stigma (i.e., the target's perspective), and intergroup relations."

Students develop a better understanding of the similarities and differences in traditional values in three East Asian cultures by comparing how canonical texts of premodern China, Japan and Korea represent romantic relationship. They explore how these values sometimes provide a given framework for a narrative and sometimes provide the definition of transgressive acts. This is followed by the study of several contemporary East Asian films, giving the student the opportunity to explore how traditional values persist, change, or become nexus points of resistance in the complicated modern and post-modern milieu of East Asian cultures maintaining a national identity while exercising an international presence.'

S'Focuses on issues arising within the practice of forensic social work in correctional settings (jails, prisons, and probation and parole departments), especially practice with people whose social positions and/or mental health struggles render them disproportionately affected by incarceration. Uses a person-in-environment perspective to explore the phenomenology of corrections, paying particular attention to the intersection of social identities and psychological capacities among individuals who are incarcerated, the complexities of the systems within which social workers attempt to create change, and the historical and contemporary role of incarceration in the United States.'

What cultural, racial, ethnic and political identities were drawn from, reconfigured, and created within these movements? What kinds of knowledge and institutions were created by these movements, and how have these legacies shaped (and been shaped by) the geography, culture, and politics of the area. As part of the ACES program, this course also engages students in creating social movement documentation through collaborations with community partners. Small student groups, supervised by an ACES Fellow, will carry out documentation projects. Also listed as Peace and Conflict Studies 148AC.'

The strong parallels between the Mediterranean-climate landscapes of Portugal and California provide excellent opportunities for comparative studies in environment and human adaptations in environment.

S'After World War II, we witnessed a "revolution" in human rights theory, practice, and institution building. The implications of viewing individuals as equal and endowed with certain rights is potentially far reaching as in the declaration that individuals hold many of those rights irrespective of the views of their government. Yet, we also live in a world of sovereign states with sovereign state\'s rights. We see everyday a clash between the rights of the individual and lack of duty to fulfill those rights when an individual\'s home state is unwilling or unable to do so. After introducing the idea of human rights, its historic development and various international human rights mechanisms, this course will ask what post-World War II conceptions of human rights mean for a number of specific issues including humanitarian intervention, international criminal justice, U.S. foreign policy, immigration, and economic rights. Looking in-depth at these five areas, we will ask how ideas about human rights, laws about human rights, and institutions to protect human rights have on how states and other global actors act, and how individuals have fared.'

Combining history, sociology, urban geography, and ethnic studies, we ask: why and how these movements emerged? What cultural, racial, ethnic and political identities were drawn from, reconfigured, and created within these movements? What kinds of knowledge and institutions were created by these movements, and how have these legacies shaped (and been shaped by) the geography, culture, and politics of the area. As part of the ACES program, this course also engages students in creating social movement documentation through collaborations with community partners. Small student groups, supervised by an ACES Fellow, will carry out documentation projects. Also listed as International and Area Studies 158AC.'

Through real stories of women's lives which reached the media in the last decade and before, students will move toward a dynamic understanding of the impact of a range of physical, emotional, and mental disabilities in the context of current social forces and public policy. We will explore historic perspectives as well as current trends in medicine, independent living, care-giving, insurance, public benefits, law, and community activism as they affect and are affected by disabled women and girls and their families. We will discuss controversial ethical issues such as prenatal screening, wrongful birth law suits, and physician-assisted suicide. Course readings will draw on the rich literature of disabled women's anthologies, biography and autobiograhpy, scholarly and popular literature of disability, feminist analyses, creative writing, women's art, film, and theatre."

S'This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis. Also listed as Mechanical Engineering C180.'

S'Supply chain analysis is the study of quantitative models that characterize various economic trade-offs in the supply chain. The field has made significant strides on both theoretical and practical fronts. On the theoretical front, supply chain analysis inspires new research ventures that blend operations research, game theory, and microeconomics. These ventures result in an unprecedented amalgamation of prescriptive, descriptive, and predictive models characteristic of each subfield. On the practical front, supply chain analysis offers solid foundations for strategic positioning, policy setting, and decision making. Also listed as Industrial Engin and Oper Research C253.'

S"This course is designed to fulfill the second half of the Reading and Composition requirement. The primary goal of this course is to develop students' reading and writing skills through a series of assignments that will provide them with the opportunity to formulate observations made in class discussions into coherent argumentative essays. Emphasis will be placed on the refinement of effective sentence, paragraph, and thesis formation, keeping in mind the notion of writing as a process. Other goals in this course are a familiarization with French literature and the specific questions that are relevant to this field. In addition, students will be introduced to different methods of literary and linguistic analysis in their nonliterary readings."

The course emphasizes an introduction to craft--how these types of writing are generated, what their elements are, and how the finished pieces work--which students will explore through careful study of models by published writers and through writing and revising their own short pieces.'

Using films as the primary texts, the course will explore the relationship between these films and the social and political contexts from which they emerged. Looking at both mainstream and independent cinema, the course will chart the continuities and varieties of representations and negotiations of "race." The course spans the 20th century, covering (among other topics) Jim Crow in silent film, Hollywood westerns and melodramas, borderland crime dramas, documentary film, and experimental cinema. This class will concentrate on the history of African Americans in film, but we will also watch movies that consider how the overlapping histories of whiteness and ethnicity, American Indians, Asian Americans, Mexican Americans, the "Third World" and "multiculturalism" have been represented in film. Themes covered include representing race and nation; the borderlands; passing and miscegenation; the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality.'

While the memorization of vocabulary and common personal exchanges practiced in 1A will make up the majority of material studied, students will have some opportunity to learn to improvise and talk about personal work and research interests in Khmer. Topics include transportation and directions, the world of work, religion, health, and conducting daily life in Cambodia. Students learn to read simple authentic texts such as folk tales, personal letters, forms, and roadside signs. Students continue their study of culturally appropriate behavior in the context of Khmer culture, including notions of "saving face" and maintaining social harmony, and how these are expressed in both spoken language and in one\'s actions.'

Biological transport phenomena are present at a wide range of length scales: molecular, cellular, organ (whole and by functional unit), and organism. This course develops and applies scaling laws and the methods of continuum mechanics to biological transport phenomena over a range of length and time scales. The course is intended for undergraduate students who have taken a course in differential equations and an introductory course in physics. Students should be familiar with basic biology; an understanding of physiology is useful, but not assumed.'

Such methods, first proposed in the 1960s by Linus Pauling (and others), are now in reach of practical experimentation due to the falling cost of DNA synthesis technology. Applications of these methods are granting insight into the origin of life and of the human species, and may be powerful tools of synthetic biology. Lectures will review the theoretical content; homework and laboratory exercises will involve writing and applying programs for computational reconstruction of ancient protein and DNA sequences and other measurably evolving entities, both biological (e.g., gene families) and otherwise (e.g., natural language).'

This course thus explores a series of visceral, unsettling juxtapositions: "freedom" and "slavery"; "citizenship" and "subjugation"; "marginalization" and "inclusion", in each case explicating the ways that story making, political demagoguery, and racial, class, and sexual inequalities have wrought an untenable social condition.

S'The goals of the course are to (a) examine how geographically-linked characteristics of species influence their potential for evolution and extinction; and (b) provide an overview of the analytical techniques and applications for studying the interplay between geographic ranges, environment, evolution, and extinction. Accordingly, the course begins by examining what geographic ranges of species are and what controls them. We then will explore how geographic-range characteristics influence and interact with speciation and extinction processes. With that foundation, we will examine how species assemble into communities and how ecological processes govern distributions at the community and landscape levels, touching on such topics as community energetics, scaling issues, and the influences of humans on "natural" ecosystems. The last third of the course will be devoted to an overview of quantitative analytical techniques that commonly are used to study interactions between biogeogeographic ranges, evolutionary processes, extinction, and environmental change.'

S'This course explores the ways that evolutionary theory can illuminate our understanding of human health and disease. The integration of evolutionary concepts into health sciences can deepen our understanding of the origins of diseases and how human populations evolve in response to these ailments. The course begins with an introduction to evolutionary medicine (two hours of lecture) followed by an overview of human genetic variation and natural selection (six hours of lecture). With this foundation, we study the evolution of human diet and the evolution of human ecological relationships with the environment (six hours of lecture). We then explore the fascinating topic of infectious disease ecology from the perspective of both microbial and human evolutionary responses (nine hours of lecture). Next, we evaluate the fields of reproductive biology, gynecology, and infant/child health through an evolutionary lens (twelve hours of lecture). Finally, we examine evolutionary concepts in chronic metabolic and degenerative diseases associated with aging and lifestyle (ten hours of lecture).'

In two independent investigations, students identify their own questions, develop hypotheses, design and perform experiments, and present their studies in symposia. Background in elementary statistics, data analysis and oral presentation are also provided.'

The course uses a comparative approach to examine the reciprocal interactions between the neuroendocrine system and behavior, considering the effects of hormone on development and adult behavior in addition to how behavior regulates endocrine physiology. While much of the course focuses on non-human vertebrate species, the relevance to humans is explored where appropriate. Topics include sexual differentiation and sex differences in behavior, reproductive, parental, and aggressive behaviors, and hormonal and behavioral homeostatic regulation.

It explores how Japanese literature and media, before and after 3:11, attempt to translate the un-representable, and in so doing, to create a new type of literacy about 1) trauma and the temporality of disaster, 2) precarity, community and the public sphere and 3) sustainability and ecological scale. The course will pay particular attention to a range of works that explicitly or obliquely reframe iconic or popular representations of disasters in cinema, literature and other media, taking into account of the readiness with which certain cultural forms lend themselves to vistas of disaster.'

The seminar is designed to be of interest to a range of graduate students working on premodern Japanese culture (literature, philosophy, intellectual history, religion, art, etc.). Students are required to do all the readings in the original languages, which are classical Chinese (Kanbun) and classical Japanese. The seminar will also serve as a "tools and methods" course, covering basic reference works for the study of Japanese Buddhism as well as secondary scholarship in Japanese. The content of the course will be adjusted from semester to semester to accommodate the needs and interests of the students. Also listed as Group in Buddhist Studies C225.'

S"This year-long research and writing group is intended for graduate students who plan to specialize in studying educational policy implementation. In the course, we will investigate what happens from the time a policy is enacted until the policy is actually implemented in classrooms, schools, and districts. The centerpiece of the research group is reviewing and providing feedback to members on their works-in-progress related to policy implementation. The goal is to strengthen participants' preparation for research in this area through a combination of consultation and feedback on specific problems related to conceptualizing and enacting high quality research, including but not limited to the formulation of research questions, theory development, research design, data collection, analysis, writing, and publication. We will supplement this activity by reading research together to help build a shared understanding of the different theoretical perspectives that can potentially imform the study of policy implementation, including institutional theory, social movements analysis, conflict perspectives, and organizational learning theroy."

Those taking the course will be introduced to the history of the field, the basic concepts and intellectual disputes, the major methodological issues, and to some common "models" of how an evaluation ought to be conducted. Based on the understandings of the topics and issues discussed in this course, participants will be asked to conceptualize and design an evaluation in their area of personal and/or professional interests.

In the fall, students began to identify a field of interest in which they most likely will conduct their research and write their dissertation. Also beginning in the fall, students familiarized themselves with templates for types of dissertations suggested for LEEP students. The second course in the milestone sequence assumes that students have made a selection of a field of interest and are ready to explore its knowledge base. The purpose of the course is to make this exploration fruitful and research-based, and for students to take first steps in applying their new knowledge to a dissertation project of a specific type. At the end of the course, students should be ready to pass the first milestone towards the dissertation: a paper mapping the professional knowledge base in their field of interest. At a later date, this paper will be submitted as one of three qualifying papers to the oral exam committee.'

S'This is an interdisciplinary survey course that seeks to understand how we define justice, evil, and individual responsibility in modern society. In particular we are going to probe carefully how humans reflect on and practice the process of moral reasoning. We will focus on human behavior in extreme situations: war, life and death conflicts, genocide and mass killing, as well as competing conceptions of human freedom. The course has a distinctive dual purpose. On the one hand we want to encourage the learning of critical thinking skills. This includes the ability to systematically evaluate information and competing moral claims. Also, it is intended as an exposure to the interdisciplinary approach. That is, how can different perspectives illuminate the same issue? With this in mind the course draws on important work from philosophy and ethics, social psychology, jurisprudential analysis, historical-political accounts, and personal memoirs.'

That is, we explore what it means to live in the modern, postmodern, hyper-modern, or global worlds. In particular we examine the nature of industrial and post-industrial social formations, cultural perceptions, and the development of ideological constructs. Changing understandings of the shapes of power and domination is a central linkage tying these various analyses together. We are particularly interested in charting the interrelationship between quickly shifting social changes on a local and global level and competing theoretical interpretations of their meaning.'

The course begins with familiar equations of Newtonian fluid mechanics, then proceeds to the study of essentially 1-D flows in confined geometries with the lubrication equations. Next is a study of the flow of thin films spreading under gravity or surface tension gradients. Lubrication theory of compressible gases leads to consideration of air bearings. Two- and 3-D flows are treated with Stokes' equations. Less familiar physical phenomena of significance and utility at the microscale are then considered: intermolecular forces in liquids, slip, diffusion and bubbles as active agents. A review of relevant aspects of electricity and magnetism precedes a study of electrowetting and electrokinetically driven liquid flows."

The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis. Also listed as Civil and Environmental Engineering C133.'

S'In this course, students learn why sound journalism is so important to a healthy, working democracy. Journalism is rapidly changing. The class will give a context to those changes and provide an overview of comtemporary journalistic institutions. Students will examine how news is made, who decides what news is, who makes it, who profits by it, and what rules guide how reporters and editors work. Central issues affecting journalism, such as bias and professionalism, will be discussed. The class is not specifically intended for future journalists, but students will learn why pursuing a career in journalism can be so fulfilling and thrilling, as well as becoming better consumers of the news.

After sharing their internship experiences and the impact on career decisions, the students are required to draw on situations from their internship to demonstrate what they have learned by leading fellow seminar participants in facilitated discussions, culminating in a specific management recommendation or policy position. Students will gain exposure to a range of HPM issues based on the experiences of their peers. Each student is also required to produce a 20-page paper and prepare and deliver a formal presentation to seminar participants and invited faculty. The paper will address an HPM topic of interest that has been selected by the student and approved by the course faculty and the student's academic advisor. Suggested formats for the paper are a policy or strategic management analysis, but other options may be proposed and approved by the instructor."

This class will emphasize the interconnected and multidirectional relationships between biology, behavior, and the social environment. This course will be conducted as a seminar series (with a focus on biological processes). We will investigate the assertion that biological, psychological, and social processes interact over a lifetime to influence health and vulnerability to disease (a developmental epigenetic perspective). Rather than focusing on "if" social factors can influence health and disease we will focus on "how" social factors may regulate/change biological measures. Three very general themes will be addressed: development, "social" neuroscience and gene-environment interactions as they relate to behavior. Topics such as constraints/plasticity and behavior, genetic determinism, vulnerability versus resilience, gene-environment interactions, fetal/developmental programming, and stress will all be touched upon.'

Four areas will be explored: 1) components of the immune system (spectrum of cell types and cell products); 2) different arms of the immune system including humoral, cell-mediated, innate, and mucosal immunity; 3) specific immune response to infection caused by viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens; and 4) disorders of the immune system unrelated to infectious disease. Through this course, students should not only gain a basic understanding of the human immune system, but also learn the functions and responses of the human immune system to diseases of infectious and non-infectious nature, and the relevance of these interactions in the context of public health problems.'

S'Scientific knowledge and analyses are important to the development of public policies that address the impact of the environment on health. The limits of existing knowledge and uncertainties in research results create significant challenges in applying science to answer critical questions. This course critically examines how scientific information is used in policy decisions. Case studies of current issues address characterization of scientific knowledge, interpretation of science in policy contexts, scientific integrity, and factors in addition to science that influence decisions. Assignments prepare students to effectively translate technical knowledge for multi-disciplinary and lay audiences and to participate in public policy proceedings. Core materials address differences between regulatory and market-based approaches; emerging paradigms including the precautionary principle and environmental justice; and key elements of risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis.'

S"The course will first provide a basic foundation in the physical and societal basis of climate change, including atmospheric structure and feedbacks, carbon cycling, and the sources and trends of human and natural greenhouse pollutant emissions. Forecasts of future climate, and their uncertainties, will be discussed, emphasizing parameters of potential relevance to human health. We will explore epidemiologic, risk assessment, and statistical methods appropriate for understanding the impact of climate on health in different populations, including reviews of current burden of disease estimates of avoidable and attributable risk. The public health implications, positive and negative, of society's efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change will be elaborated, including discussions of ethical, political, and economic aspects. The one-unit version ends before the spring break. Students in the two-unit version will continue and be responsible for formal class presentations summarizing and critiquing the evidence based on a health outcome related to climate change."

S'Geographic information systems (GIS) have emerged as an important tool for performing health and environmental analyses. GIS is generally seen as a spatial analysis system for the organization, storage, retrieval, and analysis of data for which the location and other spatial attributes are considered important (e.g., incidence of a specific disease condition in relation to a pollution source). GIS also encompasses the organizational structure, personnel, software, and hardware needed to support spatial analysis. For many health and social scientists, GIS has evolved into a new lens for viewing their work. The course will provide students with an introduction to this exciting and expanding field of inquiry. On successful completion of the course you should possess the following skills and knowledge: 1) A basic understanding of the fundamental geographic and cartographic concepts that underlie GIS. 2) Working knowledge of ArcGIS, a powerful "desktop" GIS software package that runs in a Windows environment. 3) Introductory knowledge of past, present, and possible future applications of GIS for health and environmental studies.'

We also explore ways in which the family acts as a "shock absorber" of many trends including immigration, the increasing social class divide, and especially the growing domination of the marketplace. Finally, we also explore the diversity of family forms associated with social class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.'

Looking at empirical studies and theoretical texts, we will trace the paradigm shift from late 19th century sexology to early 20th century psychoanalysis, through a variety of approaches in the 1960's and 1970's to the feminist and queer theory of recent decades."

S'This course is a continuation of our required graduate theory course. We separate modern and classical social theory by considering modern social theory to consist of works published after World War II. Modern sociological theory uses classical social theory both as a source and a foil. There have been continuities in social thought whereby more contemporary theorists view themselves as using elements of classical social theory, sometimes in combination and at other times to understand different kinds of phenomena, such as micro-interaction or gender relations. Contemporary theory has also been critical of classical theory. This has caused different theorists to construct entirely new ideas or rely on new sources for their theories. The course considers a wide variety of authors and perspectives to illustrate the current breadth of social thought.'

The course begins with a detailed explication of the thermal properties of materials, heat transfer through building assemblies, balance point temperature, solar geometry, and shading analysis. Students apply these principles later in the course to a design project. The latter part of the course also provides a survey of broader building science topics including mechanical system design, microclimate, and current developments in energy-efficient design.'

The course will cover four material groups commonly used in two areas of the building assembly (structure and envelope): wood, concrete, steel, and glass. You will understand choices available and how materials are conventionally used. By observing construction, you'll see how our decisions affect the size of materials, connections, and where they are assembled. Architects must understand not only conventions, but also the potential in materials, so we will also study unusual and new developments."

The work examines two archetypal daylighting conditions: a toplighted (roof-lighted) space and a side-lighted (window-lit) space with range of methods including readings, on-site observation and measurement, case studies, design exercises and analysis through models and simulation. This is a graduate seminar: attendance, pin-ups, readings and engaged participation are required each week.'

The centrality of these ideas respond to the increasing awareness of and opposition to the legacies of the history of conquest, colonization, racism, and sexism in the region. In this course, we are going to study the intellectual production of various ethnic groups in the Americas, particularly Latinas and Latinos in the 20th century, in order to clarify the ties between concerns for cultural and religious identity and the articulation of alternative ethical and political visions.'

S'California had been called "the great exception" and "America, only more so." Yet few of us pay attention to its distinctive traits and to its effects beyond our borders. California may be "a state of mind," but it is also the most dynamic place in the most powerful country in the world, and would be the 5th largest economy if it were a country. Its wealth has been built on mining, agriculture, industry, trade, and finance. Natural abundance and geographic advantage have played their parts, but the state\'s greatest resource has been its wealth and diversity of people, who have made it a center of technological and cultural innovation from Hollywood to Silicon Valley. Yet California has a dark side of exploitation and racialization of many peoples, and of violent efforts to exclude immigrants and control the poor. This course pursues classic themes in geography, such as regional difference, the transformation of nature, the space of cities, and the changing landscape.'

In this course, we build an understanding of global tectonics, rivers, hillslopes, and coastlines and discover how these act in concert with the underlying geologic framework to produce the magnificent landscapes of our planet. Through our review of formative processes, we learn how physical landscapes change and are susceptible to human modifications, which are often unintentional."

It studies the project of development, from its Cold War launching to its metamorphosis into the current era of economic globalization and liberalization. And it examines the theoretical models and discursive debates that have accompanied each phase, including the recent critiques put forth by feminism and postcolonialism. The course also locates development in the industrialized world, "here" rather than "elsewhere," thereby unsettling the normalized hierarchy of First and Third Worlds.'

S"This course explores the basic materials and models that set the boundaries for various present-day musical experiences. Students are exposed to terminology and modes of engagement with the aim of inspiring new paradigms of listening (e.g., listening to silence, noise, space, and timbre). Composers and musicians of today continue to explore new ways of defining and organizing sounds into music. The course focuses on the most adventurous music of our time, but the concepts learned can be applied to any style of music. The course is designed to enrich and deepen the students' musical abilities through direct involvement with musical materials. Direct engagement through listening and participatory learning is accomplished in part with software created at the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies. The course does not require students to be able to read music nor to own a personal computer."

By critically evaluating research, students determine which characteristics of an empirical paper influence the finance profession.'

S"Antebellum American political history generally follows a routine script in which the purpose of the Revolution was to liberate Americans for self-government and economic and social development. Slavery is viewed as an anomaly still needing explanation, and Native American relocation as the consequence of natural forces of immigration and pre-modern social values. In this class, the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British crown, the rise of slavery, and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in the 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials, including biographies, history, and literature, and contemporary images from American popular culture such as film, news and magazine articles, and music, we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans, Euopean immigrants, and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges."

S"The European Union is the world's most advanced experiment in governance beyond the level of the traditional nation-state. Through the European Union, the main members countries have pooled their national sovereignty and created new ways political authority, economic competition, social cohesion, and cultural identity. While specialists in comparative politics focus on the separate countries, scholars in international relations emphasize the construction of supranational institutions and transnational identities. This course seeks to synthesize the comparative and international approaches by examining the economic, political, and cultural aspects of integration. Readings are drawn from international relations, comparative politics, public policy, sociology, and some anthropological debates. Course requirements include careful preparation of the readings, discussion sections, participation in a group report on one of the major domains mentioned above, and a closed-book final."

This course looks at the continual process of international competition and transformation, and examines which factors separate the winners from the losers. We will gain leverage into these questions by examining critical moments in the 20th and 21st centuries and analyze according to national responses. What choices signal success? Can the failures be avoided? The course will discuss whether globalization is shunting aside national political choice, or whether globalization is in fact a sequence of national and regional stories played out on a larger stage. We will consider how economic constraint structures political choice and national response to the global economy. But we will also examine how political developments shape market dynamics and national innovations. We will learn about all sorts of things from the politics of French fashion to why Japanese make good cars.'

This course explores the way societies try to address and solve difficult and seemingly intractable public problems. Can we attribute success or failure to institutions and their capacity to solve problems? Are problems difficult to solve because they are complex or because of a failure of political will? What are the characteristics of organizations or communities that are able to solve problems? How are public problems framed and how are they used to mobilize constituencies? The course draws on literature in public administration, public policy studies, and democratic theory to try to better understand some of the major social, political, environmental, and economic problems of our contemporary world.'

The Romanovs believed that autocracy was the key to good governance. Yet, the reigns of almost all the Romanov Emperors were marked by coups d'etat, peasant rebellions, and, later, assassination attempts. Russia's expanding boundaries and growing population made it even more difficult to rule. This course will focus heavily on political history and political thought. Given the many factors that were tearing Peter's Empire apart, it will ask, what held it together for so many years?"

The broader story told in the class weaves together in the history of science and engineering, the arts and popular culture, philosophy, and education. Our goal is to trace how ideas, whether they are dominant, challenging, or look back, have affected the ways in which Americans live together. We will look at how intellectual life has empowered and expanded the capacity of Americans to understand their world and achieve goals more effectively. We will also consider how intellectual theories have contributed to inequality and injustice. Also listed as American Studies C132B.'

Only in the past two hundred years have the physicial spaces, social relations, and lifestyles associated with large cities entered the mainstream. This course examines the long century of urban growth between 1825 and 1933, when big cities came into being in the United States. Focusing on large metropolitian centers (especially on New York, Chicago, and San Francisco), we will study the way urban spaces provided sites and sources of new modes of personal interaction, popular entertainment, social conflict, and political expression.'

This small, cold, and wet island was thought to have been the first to develop representative democracy, an industrial economy, rapid transport, mass cities, mass communication and mass culture, and, of course, an empire upon which the sun famously never set. And yet, despite this precocious modernity, imperial Britain remained a deeply traditional society unable to rid itself of ancient institutions like the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the established church. The focus of the course is on how this combination of the old and the new produced a broadly 'liberal' set of mentalities through which Britons came to understand and manage the great transformations of modern life, both at home and across the empire."

To answer these questions, this course tests a new karyotypic theory, which postulates that cancers evolve much like new species.'

S'This course will encompass three important facets of graduate education in the neurosciences: 1) Development of research presentation skills: fourth and fifth year graduate students will present seminars based on their ongoing dissertation research. Preparation and critiques of presentations will focus on organization of conceptual issues, data presentation, and summarization. 2) Exposure to current topics in neuroscience: faculty speakers will present on current issues and topics relevant to scientific development in the neurosciences, such as technical methods, application of analytical and statistical techniques, and organization and preparation of competitive fellowship and other grant applications. 3) Seminar preparation: a crucial aspect of graduate education is the interaction of students with invited seminar speakers - who are often leaders in their fields. A selected number of class meetings will be devoted to the review of scientific articles published by upcoming seminar speakers and/or other related articles in the field.'
